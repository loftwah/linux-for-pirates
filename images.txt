Based on the expanded Linux for Pirates book, here's a list of all the new images you'll need to create:

1. `/images/networking-pirate.png` - Pirate navigating network connections
2. `/images/docker-pirate.png` - Pirate with container ships
3. `/images/merge-conflict-pirate.png` - Pirate resolving conflicts on a map
4. `/images/database-pirate.png` - Pirate organizing treasure in database chests
5. `/images/service-pirate.png` - Pirate managing automated ship services
6. `/images/blockdiagram-pirate.png` - Pirate drawing system diagrams
7. `/images/package-pirate.png` - Pirate managing supply crates/packages
8. `/images/oh-my-zsh-pirate.png` - Pirate with fancy command deck
9. `/images/hardware-pirate.png` - Pirate examining computer hardware
10. `/images/cloud-pirate.png` - Pirate with different cloud provider ships
11. `/images/pr-pirate.png` - Pirate submitting a treasure map for review
12. `/images/load-balancer-pirate.png` - Pirate distributing cargo across ships
13. `/images/ai-pirate.png` - Pirate using AI assistant to generate maps
14. `/images/enterprise-pirate.png` - Pirate in corporate fleet uniform

16. `/images/conclusion-pirate.png` - Pirate captain with treasure chest of skills
17. `/images/backup-pirate.png` - Pirate making copies of treasure maps

Each image should maintain the pirate theme while illustrating the technical concept of the section it represents. The style should be consistent with the existing images in the book.
