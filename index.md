## **In memory of Aaron Swartz**

[The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc)

> **Note** This is a **must** watch documentary.

![Aaron Swartz](images/aaronswartz.png)

[Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) was a computer programmer, entrepreneur, and internet activist who made significant contributions to the development of the internet and the open access movement.

Aaron was born in 1986, and became interested in computers and the internet at a young age. He was a brilliant and talented programmer, and was known for his ability to quickly grasp and master new technologies. He co-authored the RSS 1.0 specification at the age of 14, and went on to work on a variety of other projects, including the development of the Creative Commons license, the building of the first consumer web feed platform, and the creation of the social news site Reddit.

![Aaron Swartz as a Pirate](images/aaron-swartz-pirate.png)

Aaron was also a strong advocate for open access, which is the movement to make knowledge and information freely available to all, rather than being locked behind paywalls and controlled by a few powerful corporations or institutions. He believed that access to knowledge and information was a fundamental right, and that it should be freely available to everyone.

Aaron's work had a major impact on the development of the internet and the open access movement, and he is remembered as a pioneer and a hero by many in the tech community. Tragically, Aaron took his own life in 2013, at the age of 26. His legacy lives on through the work of those who continue to fight for open access and the free flow of information. Arrr!

## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### **What is open source software?**

Open source software is software that is freely available to anyone who wants to use it, modify it, or distribute it. It is a model for software development that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code.

Open source software is often developed using a model called "open source development", which is a process that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code. In this model, the source code for the software is made available to the community, and anyone can contribute to the project by writing code, fixing bugs, or improving the software in some way.

#### **What are open source licenses?**

Open source licenses are legal documents that grant users the right to use, modify, and distribute open source software. They are used to protect the rights of the developers and users of open source software, and to ensure that the software remains free and open.

There are many different open source licenses, and each one has its own set of rules and requirements. The most popular open source licenses are the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the MIT License.

#### **What is the GNU General Public License (GPL)?**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free and open-source software license that is used by many open source projects. It is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works can only be distributed under the same license terms.

The GPL was originally developed by Richard Stallman in 1989, and was released as open source software under the GNU General Public License. It is one of the most widely used open source licenses, and is used by many popular open source projects, including the Linux kernel, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and the GNU C Library (glibc).

#### **What is the MIT License?**

The MIT License is a free and open-source software license that is used by many open source projects. It is a permissive license, which means that derivative works can be distributed under any license.

The MIT License was originally developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980, and was released as open source software under the MIT License. It is one of the most widely used open source licenses, and is used by many popular open source projects, including the Node.js runtime, the jQuery JavaScript library, and the Angular web framework.

## **Before we begin**

Loftwah stood at the helm of his ship, staring out at the vast expanse of the ocean. He had been a pirate for as long as he could remember, and he loved nothing more than the thrill of the hunt and the rush of adrenaline that came with finding treasure.

But Loftwah was no ordinary pirate. He was a master of technology, using his advanced gadgets and devices to outsmart his enemies and outmaneuver them on the high seas. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic," he thought to himself, smiling at the thought of all the treasure he had acquired through his clever use of technology.

But even Loftwah knew that technology was not always the answer. He had learned the hard way that "social engineering bypasses all technologies, including firewalls." He had lost more than one treasure to clever pirates who used their charm and charisma to manipulate him and his crew.

Loftwah was not one to accept defeat easily, though. "People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world," he thought, determined to find a way to outsmart even the most clever of his rivals.

And so he set his sights on the greatest treasure of them all: the fabled Black Pearl, a ship that was said to be filled with unimaginable riches. Loftwah knew that he couldn't do it alone, though. He needed a crew of skilled pirates who were just as determined and clever as he was.

As he searched for the perfect crewmates, Loftwah couldn't help but think about the dangers of relying too much on technology. "The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers," he thought, knowing that it was important to keep a balance between using technology and using one's own intelligence and creativity.

Finally, Loftwah found the perfect crew. They were a diverse group, each with their own unique skills and talents. Together, they set off on their quest for the Black Pearl, using all of their combined knowledge and expertise to outsmart their enemies and navigate the dangerous waters.

As they sailed closer and closer to their goal, Loftwah couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and determination. "Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success," he thought, knowing that they would stop at nothing to claim the treasure that was rightfully theirs.

And in the end, their hard work paid off. They found the Black Pearl, and it was even more magnificent than they had imagined. "It doesn't matter what you know, what matters is when you know," Loftwah thought as he gazed at the treasure-filled ship, knowing that their knowledge and skills had been key to their success.

As they sailed back home, filled with treasure and stories to tell, Loftwah couldn't help but feel grateful for the diverse and skilled crew that he had assembled. He knew that it was their combined knowledge and creativity that had led them to victory, and he couldn't wait to see what other adventures they would have together in the future.

## **About the author (This isn't on the test)**

![Dean Lofts](images/deanlofts.png)

Once upon a time, in the golden age of piracy, there lived a fearless pirate by the name of Dean (Loftwah) Lofts. Loftwah was a notorious buccaneer, known throughout the seven seas for their technical expertise and programming prowess.

Loftwah commanded a fearsome crew of pirates, who sailed the high seas in search of treasure and adventure. They were a motley crew, made up of scallywags, scoundrels, and ne'er-do-wells from every corner of the globe, including the wild and untamed shores of Australia.

Together, Loftwah and their crew roamed the Caribbean, plundering and pillaging their way from island to island. They braved fierce storms and battled fierce foes, always coming out on top thanks to Loftwah's quick wit and sharp sword, as well as their formidable knowledge of Bash, PHP, Python, Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, and other programming languages.

One day, Loftwah and the crew set their sights on a rich Spanish galleon, loaded down with gold and jewels. They crept up on the ship under cover of darkness, and with a mighty roar, they boarded the vessel and took control.

The Spanish crew fought bravely, but they were no match for the fierce pirates led by Loftwah. In the end, Loftwah and their crew emerged victorious, the galleon was theirs for the taking.

As they sailed off into the sunset with their prize, Loftwah raised their fist to the sky and let out a mighty "YARGH!" It was a good day to be a pirate.

So if you ever find yourself sailing the high seas and you see a pirate flag with a Loftwah-shaped skull and crossbones on it, beware! You're in for a wild ride with the fearless Loftwah and their trusty crew. Ahoy, matey!

#### **Cybersecurity**

[Awesome Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)

Arrr, ye landlubbers might be wonderin' what a cybersecurity analyst does. Let me tell ya, they be the protectors of yer digital treasure, keepin' yer network free from any cyber scallywags and their sneaky tricks. They be analyzin' and keepin' a watchful eye on yer network security, respondin' to any security breaches or attacks, implementin' security measures like firewalls and antivirus software, and workin' with other scallywags such as developers and legal to make sure yer network is shipshape and compliant with all the rules and regulations.

When it comes to network security, there be three types of teams that be playin' important roles in keepin' the ship afloat: blue, purple, and red teams.

The blue team be like the ship's navigator, chartin' the course to keep the ship out of harm's way. They be protectin' the network from any cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

The purple team be like the ship's surgeon, patchin' up any wounds and keepin' an eye out for any potential dangers. They be identifyin' and exploitin' vulnerabilities and reportin' their findings to the captain with recommendations on how to avoid them.

The red team be like the ship's enemy, testin' the ship's defenses and tryin' to sink it. They be simulating the tactics and techniques of a real enemy to test the effectiveness of the ship's security measures and reportin' their findings to the captain with recommendations on how to improve the ship's defenses.

All three teams be playin' important roles in keepin' the ship safe and sailin' smooth. So, hoist the anchor and set sail on the digital seas with a crew of cybersecurity scallywags by yer side!

A penetration tester be the scallywag that be responsible for findin' and exploitin' vulnerabilities in yer network. They be like treasure hunters, searchin' for any weak spots in yer digital defenses and takin' advantage of them to gain unauthorized access to yer sensitive information or systems. They be reportin' their findings to the captain and givin' recommendations on how to prevent similar attacks from happenin' in the future. They also be workin' closely with other scallywags such as developers and legal to ensure yer network is shipshape and compliant with all the rules and regulations.

But watch out for those sneaky phishermen, tryin' to trick ye into givin' up yer treasure with fake emails and malicious links. And don't be fallin' for any social engineering tricks, where scallywags use their charm and deception to steal yer sensitive information.

And remember the infamous Kevin Mitnick, a notorious hacker who was once one of the most wanted scallywags in the world. He be now a cybersecurity consultant and public speaker, and ye can even watch his story in the movie "Takedown".

In the realm of network security, there be three key roles that be playin' important roles in keepin' the ship afloat: security architecture, security compliance, and security engineering.

The security architect be like the ship's designer, creatin' and maintainin' the overall security of the network.

The security compliance analyst be like the ship's lawyer, ensurin' the network is compliant with all the rules and regulations.

The security engineer be like the ship's mechanic, implementin' and maintainin' the security controls of the network.

All three roles be playin' important roles in keepin' the ship safe and sailin' smooth. So, hoist the anchor and set sail on the digital seas with a crew of cybersecurity scallywags by yer side!

## **Chapter Two - The Fundamentals**

![Chapter Two - The Fundamentals](images/fundamentals.png)

Ahoy mateys! If ye be lookin' to set sail on the Linux sea, here be some things ye'll need to know:

**Learn the command line:** The command line be the primary way to interact with a Linux system, so it be important to learn the basic commands and how to navigate the file system.

**Understand file permissions:** In Linux, each file and directory be owned by a specific user and group, and have permissions that control who can read, write, or execute them. It be important to understand how to set and manage these permissions.

**Install and manage software:** In Linux, software be installed and managed using package managers like apt or yum. Ye'll need to learn how to use these tools to install and update software on yer system.

**Work with users and groups:** In Linux, users and groups be used to control access to resources on the system. Ye'll need to learn how to create and manage users and groups, and how to set up user accounts and permissions.

**Customize yer system:** Linux be highly customizable, and ye can tweak yer system to suit yer needs and preferences. Ye'll need to learn how to customize yer system's settings, install and configure desktop environments, and more.

### **What is DevOps?**

Ahoy matey! Let's talk about DevOps, ye landlubbers!

![DevOps Pirate](images/devops-pirate.png)

DevOps be a bunch o' tools, practices, and a philosophy that be gettin' the software development and IT teams walkin' the plank together. It be all about workin' as a crew, communicatin' like parrots, and automatin' all the processes!

Yarr, this be startin' 'round 2007, when the software development and IT teams started grievin' 'bout the old way of doin' things, with the developers writin' code and the IT operations hoisting the sails and keepin' the ship afloat. But DevOps changed all that! It brought the two teams together, like rum and coconuts!

Under DevOps, there be no more "silos". Sometimes, the two teams be mergin' into one big happy crew, with engineers workin' on all parts of the journey from developin' to deploying and operatin'.

DevOps teams use tools to make the journey smoother and quicker, like a good set of sails on a calm day. They use a bunch o' tools called the "DevOps toolchain" to help 'em tackle the important stuff, like continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and workin' together like a well-oiled crew!

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team and even the security teams be gettin' in on the action, with a thing called "DevSecOps". It's like havin' a lookout on the masthead, keepin' a keen eye out for danger at all times!

The DevOps journey be like a never-endin' loop, always improvin' and changin', like the wind direction on a voyage. It's made up of eight phases, representin' the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development and operations. And throughout it all, the teams be workin' and communicatin' together, like a good crew on a ship!

So hoist the sails and set course for DevOps, me hearties! Yarrr!

### **How DevOps Works?**

Under the DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer siled. Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

It is an ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

### **Handybilly**

A handybilly is a notebook that a pirate should carry with them at all times. It be used to keep track of important information, such as passwords, notes, and other useful tidbits. Ye can use yer handybilly to keep track of the information that ye learn in this book.

`ls`: This command be used to list the files and directories in a directory. Ye can use it to see what be in yer current directory or specify a different directory to list.

`cd`: This command be used to change the current directory ye be working in. Ye can use it to navigate to different directories on yer system.

`pwd`: This command be used to print the current working directory. Ye can use it to see where ye be in the file system.

`mkdir`: This command be used to create a new directory. Ye can use it to create directories to organize yer files.

`touch`: This command be used to create a new file. Ye can use it to create empty files or update the timestamp on an existing file.

`cp`: This command be used to copy files and directories. Ye can use it to make copies of yer files or move them to different locations on yer system.

`mv`: This command be used to move or rename files and directories. Ye can use it to rearrange yer files or change their names.

`rm`: This command be used to delete files and directories. Ye can use it to remove unwanted files from yer system.

### **Linux filesystem**

Ahoy matey! Welcome to the world of Linux filesystems, where we navigate through the vast ocean of data like pirates searching for buried treasure.

In the Linux filesystem, everything is organized into a single tree structure, starting at the root directory represented by a forward slash (/). This root directory contains all the other directories and files on the system, and can be thought of as the base of the tree.

Within the root directory, there are several subdirectories that serve important functions. For example, the "home" directory (/home) is where each user on the system has their own personal space to store their files and documents. The "etc" directory (/etc) contains configuration files for the system, while the "bin" directory (/bin) stores executable programs that are used by the system and its users.

Just like on a pirate ship, each member of the crew has their own designated areas to store their belongings. Similarly, in the Linux filesystem, each user has their own home directory where they can store their files and personalize their environment.

But be warned, matey! Just like how a pirate's treasure is guarded by treacherous traps and obstacles, the Linux filesystem also has its own set of permissions and ownership rules. Only certain users are allowed access to certain files and directories, and it's up to the system administrator (the captain of the ship) to set these permissions and make sure everything is running smoothly.

So set sail and explore the seas of data, but always remember to respect the rules of the Linux filesystem and the hierarchies of ownership and access. Arrr!

#### **Filesystem examples**

Aye aye, matey! Here are some examples of common tasks that a pirate (or a Linux user) might encounter when using the Linux filesystem:

**Navigating the filesystem:** Just like how a pirate navigates the open seas, a Linux user can navigate the filesystem using the `cd` command to change directories and the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory. For example, to navigate to the root directory, a pirate might type `cd /`, and to see a list of the files and directories within the current directory, they might type `ls`.

**Creating and deleting files and directories:** A pirate might need to create a new file or directory to store their loot or maps. To do this, they can use the `touch` command to create a new file or the `mkdir` command to create a new directory. For example, to create a new file called `treasure_map.txt` within the current directory, a pirate might type `touch treasure_map.txt`. To delete a file or directory, they can use the `rm` command. For example, to delete the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `rm treasure_map.txt`.

**Copying and moving files and directories:** A pirate might need to copy or move a file or directory from one location to another, just like how they might need to move their treasure chest from one part of the ship to another. To copy a file or directory, a pirate can use the `cp` command, and to move a file or directory, they can use the `mv` command. For example, to copy the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `cp treasure_map.txt /home`. To move the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `mv treasure_map.txt /home`.

**Viewing and editing files:** A pirate might need to view the contents of a file or edit it to update their treasure map. To view the contents of a file, a pirate can use the `cat` command, and to edit a file, they can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. For example, to view the contents of the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `cat treasure_map.txt`, and to edit the file `treasure_map.txt` using the `nano` text editor, they might type `nano treasure_map.txt`.

I hope these examples give you a better understanding of how the Linux filesystem works and how a pirate might use it to complete common tasks. Arrr!

#### **Permissions**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, file permissions are like the rules and regulations that govern access to a pirate's treasure. Just like how a pirate might only allow certain members of their crew to access their treasure, in Linux, file permissions control who is allowed to read, write, and execute specific files and directories.

Each file and directory in the Linux filesystem has an owner and a group associated with it. The owner is the user who created the file or directory, and the group is a collection of users that the owner can assign permissions to. File permissions can be set for the owner, the group, and everyone else (referred to as "others").

There are three types of permissions that can be set for each file or directory: read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`). The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. The write permission allows a user to modify or delete a file or add or remove files from a directory. The execute permission allows a user to execute a file as a program or to enter a directory and access its contents.

File permissions can be displayed using the `ls -l` command, which shows a list of files and directories along with their permissions. For example, the output might look something like this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 pirate pirate 4096 Jan 1 00:00 treasure_chest
```

The first character (d) indicates that this is a directory. The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the permissions for the owner, the next three (r-x) represent the permissions for the group, and the final three (`r-x`) represent the permissions for others.

To change the permissions of a file or directory, a pirate can use the `chmod` command. For example, to give the owner and the group read and write permissions for the file `treasure_map.txt`, but only read permission for others, a pirate might type `chmod 640 treasure_map.txt`.

I hope this helps you understand how file permissions work in Linux and how a pirate might use them to control access to their treasures. Arrr!

##### **chmod**

Ahoy matey! The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. Ye can use it to give or remove read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, the group, and others.

```bash
# Add execute for all (treasurehunter.sh)
chmod a+x treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute, group/global to read only (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod u=rwx, go=r treasurehunter.sh
# Remove write from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod a-w treasurehunter.sh
# Remove read/write/execute from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod = treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write and group/global read (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 644 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute and group/global read/execute (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 755 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user/group/global to read/write (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 666 treasurehunter.sh
```

##### **chown**

Ahoy matey! The `chown` command is used to change the owner and group of a file or directory. Ye can use it to change the owner and group of a file or directory to a specific user or group.

```bash
# Change owner to pirate (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate and group to pirates (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate:pirates treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate recursively (treasure_chest)

### **Networking**

[PacketLife](https://packetlife.net/)

Ahoy there me hearties! Welcome to the wonderful world of computer networking, where the bytes flow like rum and the packets be flyin' like cannonballs. Ye be a fresh recruit to the tech industry, and it be time for ye to learn the ropes of this digital high seas.

First things first, let's talk about the lingo of the land. Ye be hearin' words like "MAC addresses" and "frames" thrown around like a shanty at a crew singalong. A MAC address be a unique identifier for a device on a network, kind of like a pirate's tattoo. And frames, why they be like the hull of a ship, holdin' all the important information together as it travels across the network.

Next, we have packets, the little buccaneers of data, carryin' information from one port to another. And just like how a pirate ship needs a crew to navigate, packets be usin' protocols like TCP and IP to make sure they reach their destination safe and sound.

And what be a network without a map? Ye be needin' IP addresses to navigate these digital waters and find yer way to other ships. And just like how ye need a compass to find true north, ye be usin' DNS to find the IP address of a website.

Routing protocols be like the maps and compass of the network world, they help guide packets to their destination. Let's take a look at some of the most commonly used ones:

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** This be a link state routing protocol, it's used mostly in large enterprise networks and service providers. It builds a map of the entire network and uses the shortest path to route the packets.

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** This be a Cisco proprietary protocol, it's similar to OSPF but it's more efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and faster convergence. It's mostly used in Cisco networks.

**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** This be one of the oldest routing protocols, it's simple to configure and it's mostly used in small networks. It uses hop count as the metric for determining the best path for routing.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** This be the king of routing protocols, it's used to route packets between different autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. It's more complex to configure than the other protocols and it's mostly used by service providers and large organizations. It uses a path vector algorithm to determine the best path.

**IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** This be another link-state routing protocol, it's mainly used in large service provider networks and it's similar to OSPF.

So, as you may expect BGP be specially important for internet routing and used for interconnect different networks, it's a robust and complex protocol that requires a good understanding of how internet routing works.

So there ye have it, a quick overview of the most common routing protocols. Remember, just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator, a network needs a good routing protocol to reach its destination.

So grab yerself a mug of grog and set sail on this journey through the tech industry. And remember, always keep a lookout for them scallywag hackers tryin' to steal yer treasure.

Yarr!

`arp`: This command be used to display and manipulate the system's ARP cache. Ye can use it to view the ARP cache, add or delete entries, and more.

  Ahoy matey! An ARP request be like a call to the crew of another ship, askin' for their location on the network. Ye see, on a ship, ye need to know where everyone be to coordinate yer actions. Same goes for a network, each device needs to know the location of other devices to communicate with them.

  An ARP request be a broadcast message sent by a device, askin' other devices on the network "Where be the device with this IP address? Give me its MAC address so I can talk to it." And just like how a crew member would respond with their location, the other devices on the network respond with their MAC address.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good lookout to spot other ships, a network needs ARP to spot other devices and communicate with them.

  Yarr!

`ip`: This command be used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

`ping`: This command be used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. Ye can use it to check if yer system be able to reach another device on the network.

`traceroute`: This command be used to trace the route between yer system and another device on the network. Ye can use it to see the path that packets be taking between yer system and the destination.

`netstat`: This command be used to display information about yer system's network connections and routing tables. Ye can use it to view information about active connections and network routes.

  Ahoy matey! ICMP be like a messenger bird for yer network, it be used for sendin' error messages and status information between devices. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs to send messages to other ships to coordinate actions, a network needs to send messages to other devices to coordinate communication.

  ICMP be used for a variety of things, such as letting a device know that it can't reach a destination, or that a destination is too busy to respond. It also be used for diagnostic purposes, such as the "ping" command, which be like shoutin' "Ahoy!" to a ship to see if they be there.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good messenger to send important messages, a network needs ICMP to send important information between devices.

  SNMP be like the ship's log of yer network, it be used for keepin' track of all the happenings on the network and givin' ye information about the devices connected to it. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs a log to keep track of its journey, a network needs SNMP to keep track of what's happening on it.

  SNMP be used for monitorin' and managin' devices on a network, it be used to gather information about the devices, such as their uptime, CPU usage, and memory usage, and it can also be used to change settings on the devices.

  SNMP be based on a client-server model, the devices on the network be the "servers" and the network management system be the "client". The client sends SNMP requests to the servers and the servers respond with the requested information.

  SNMP is one of the most common protocol for network management, it's easy to use and widely supported by many different vendors. And just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator to find its way, a network needs SNMP to find its way around and keep track of everything.

  Yarr!

`route`: This command be used to view and modify the routing table on yer system. Ye can use it to add, delete, or modify routes on yer system.

#### **ip**

Ahoy matey! The `ip` command is used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

```bash
# To display all interfaces with addresses:

ip link set dev wlan0 {up|down}
# To set a static IP and netmask:
ip addr add 192.168.1.100/32 dev eth0
# To remove a IP from an interface:
ip addr del 192.168.1.100/32 dev eth0
# To remove all IPs from an interface:
ip address flush dev eth0
# To display all routes:
ip route
# To display all routes for IPv6:
ip -6 route
# To add default route via gateway IP:

# To change your mac address :
ip link set dev eth0 address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
# To view neighbors (using ARP and NDP):
ip neighbor show
```

#### **Netcat**

Ahoy matey! Netcat, or `nc`, is a command-line utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, `nc` can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

```bash
# To open a TCP connection from <src-port> to <dest-port> of <dest-host>, with a timeout of <seconds>
nc -p <src-port> -w <seconds> <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Open a TCP connection from <src-port> to <dest-port> on <dest-host>, with a deadline of <seconds>"
# To open a UDP connection to <dest-port> of <dest-host>:
nc -u <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Open a UDP connection to <dest-port> on <dest-host>"
# To open a TCP connection to port 42 of <host> using <source-host> as the IP for the local end of the connection:
nc -s <source-host> <dest-host> <port>   # "Open a TCP connection to port 42 on <dest-host> using <source-host> as the IP for the local end"
# To create and listen on a UNIX-domain stream socket:
nc -lU /var/tmp/dsocket   # "Create and listen on a UNIX-domain stream socket at /var/tmp/dsocket"
# To connect to <dest-port> of <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>,
# <proxy-port>. This example could also be used by ssh(1); see the ProxyCommand
# directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.
nc -x<proxy-host>:<proxy-port> -Xconnect <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Connect to <dest-port> on <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>:<proxy-port>"
# The same example again, this time enabling proxy authentication with username "ruser" if the proxy requires it:
nc -x<proxy-host>:<proxy-port> -Xconnect -Pruser <host> <port>   # "Connect to <dest-port> on <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>:<proxy-port>, enabling proxy authentication with username 'ruser' if necessary"
# To choose the source IP for the testing using the -s option
nc -zv -s source_IP target_IP Port   # "Choose the source IP for the testing using the -s option to connect to <target_IP> on <Port>"
```

#### **nmap**

Ahoy matey! Nmap, or the Network Mapper, is a command-line utility for network exploration and security auditing. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, `nmap` can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

```bash

```

#### **tcpdump**

Ahoy matey! Tcpdump, or the packet sniffer, is a command-line utility for network traffic analysis. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, `tcpdump` can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

```bash
# Capture all packets and save them to a file:

```

#### **Wireshark**

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

Ahoy matey! Wireshark, or the network protocol analyzer, is a graphical utility for network traffic analysis. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, Wireshark can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

### **Bash**

Ahoy matey! Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Just like how a pirate might use a compass to navigate through the open seas, Bash helps users navigate and interact with their operating system by allowing them to enter commands and execute programs.

Bash is a powerful tool that allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks, including running programs, creating and editing files and directories, and managing system processes. It also provides features like command history, tab completion, and shell scripting, which allow users to automate tasks and customize their environment.

To use Bash, a pirate would open a terminal window and type commands at the prompt. The prompt is a symbol that indicates that Bash is ready to accept commands, and it usually looks something like this:

```bash
pirate@cove:~$
```

The prompt includes the username (pirate), the hostname (cove), and the current working directory (indicated by the tilde character).

Bash supports a wide variety of commands, including built-in commands like `ls` (list the contents of a directory) and `cd` (change the current working directory), as well as external programs like `grep` (search for patterns in text) and `awk` (process text).

I hope this helps you understand what Bash is and how a pirate might use it to interact with their operating system. Arrr!

#### **.bashrc**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.bashrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user logs in to their system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.bashrc` file can be used to customize a user's environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.bashrc` file might look something like this:

```bash
# Set the prompt to include the current time
PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h \[\e[33m\]\w\[\e[35m\] \t\[\e[m\]\$ "

# Set the default editor to Vim
export EDITOR=vim

# Set an alias for the ls command
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

The first line sets the prompt to include the current time. The second line sets the default editor to Vim. The third line sets an alias for the `ls` command, which is a shortcut that can be used to run the command. For example, a pirate could type `ls` instead of `ls --color=auto`.

#### **Bash scripting**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, Bash scripting is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to automate tasks and customize their environment. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash scripts can be used to automate common tasks and make it easier for users to perform repetitive operations.

A Bash script is a plain text file that contains a series of commands that are executed in order. For example, a pirate might create a script that backs up their important documents to a USB drive. The script might look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Backup important documents to a USB drive
cp -r /home/pirate/Documents /media/usb
```

The first line of the script is called the shebang, and it tells the system which program should be used to execute the script. In this case, the shebang tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script.

The second line is a comment, which is a line that is ignored by the system. Comments are useful for providing information about the script, such as what it does and how it should be used.

The third line is the actual command that is executed by the script. In this case, the command copies the `Documents` directory from the user's home directory to the USB drive.

I hope this helps you understand what Bash scripting is and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks and customize their environment. Arrr!

#### **Bash history**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the Bash history can be used to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session.

The Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `cd` command to change the current directory, the `ls` command will be added to the Bash history.

The Bash history can be viewed by using the `history` command. The `history` command will display a list of commands that have been executed in the current session, along with the line number of each command. The line number can be used to re-execute a command.

I hope this helps you understand what the Bash history is and how a pirate might use it to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Arrr!

#### **Bash one-liners**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash one-liners can be used to perform a single task.

A Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `grep` command to search for a specific file, the `ls | grep` command will be a Bash one-liner.

Bash one-liners can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, including searching for files, counting lines, and sorting text. The `man` command can be used to view the manual page for a command, which will provide information about how the command can be used.

I hope this helps you understand what a Bash one-liner is and how a pirate might use it to perform a single task. Arrr!

- "I be needin' to list all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`ls`

- "I be needin' to see the contents of this file, arrr!"

`cat [filename]`

- "I be needin' to search for a specific string in all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`grep "[search string]" *`

- "I be needin' to see all the processes runnin' on this machine, arrr!"

`ps aux`

- "I be needin' to see the available disk space on this machine, arrr!"

`df -h`

- "I be needin' to see the network connections on this machine, arrr!"

`netstat -tulpn`

- "I be needin' to see the system logs, arrr!"

`tail -f /var/log/syslog`

### **chroot**

Ahoy matey! The `chroot` command is used to change the root directory for the current shell session. Ye can use it to run a command or shell with a different root directory.

```bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (bash)
chroot /tmp bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (sh)
chroot /tmp sh
# Change root directory to /tmp (zsh)
chroot /tmp zsh
# Change root directory to /tmp (fish)
chroot /tmp fish
```

### **Cron**

[Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, cron is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to schedule tasks to be automatically executed at a specific time or interval. This can be useful for tasks that need to be run regularly, such as backing up important documents or cleaning up temporary files.

Cron uses a configuration file called the `crontab` to specify the tasks that it should execute. Each line in the crontab file represents a single task, and consists of six fields separated by spaces:

Minute (0-59)
Hour (0-23)
Day of the month (1-31)
Month of the year (1-12)
Day of the week (0-6, with 0 representing Sunday)
Command to execute
For example, to schedule a task to be executed every day at midnight, a pirate might add the following line to their crontab file:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/task
```

To edit the crontab file, a pirate can use the `crontab -e` command. This will open the file in a text editor, where they can add, modify, or delete tasks as needed.

It's important to note that cron tasks are executed with the permissions of the user who owns the crontab file, so it's important to make sure that the tasks have the necessary permissions to run correctly.

I hope this helps you understand how cron works and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks on their Linux system. Arrr!

### **Devices**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a device is a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, devices can be used to interact with the operating system.

A device can be thought of as a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system.

The `lsblk` command can be used to view a list of all the devices that are currently connected to the system. The `lsblk` command will display a list of devices, along with information about each device, such as the device name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a device is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Drivers**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a driver is a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, drivers can be used to interact with the operating system.

A driver can be thought of as a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system. The driver for the USB drive allows the device to interact with the operating system.

The `lsmod` command can be used to view a list of all the drivers that are currently loaded on the system. The `lsmod` command will display a list of drivers, along with information about each driver, such as the driver name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a driver is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Processes**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a process is a program that is currently running on the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, processes can be used to perform tasks and interact with the operating system.

A process can be thought of as an instance of a program. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

A process can be thought of as a program that is currently running on the system. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

An example of how to kill a process using the `kill` command:

```bash
kill 1234
```

To find the process ID of a process, a pirate can use the `ps` command. The `ps` command will display a list of processes, along with information about each process, such as the process ID, name, and status.

I hope this helps you understand what a process is and how a pirate might use it to perform tasks and interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **curl**

curl be a command line tool for transferring data using various network protocols. It be a powerful tool that be widely used by systems administrators and developers for a variety of tasks, such as testing APIs, downloading files, and more. Here be some basics ye should know to use cURL:

**Syntax:** The basic syntax for using cURL be `curl [options] [URL]`. Ye can specify various options to control how cURL be behavior, and then specify the URL of the resource ye be requesting.

**Protocols:** cURL support a wide range of network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more. Ye can specify the protocol ye be using by including it in the URL, or ye can use the -P option to specify the protocol.

**HTTP methods:** cURL support all of the HTTP methods, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. Ye can use the `-X` option to specify the method ye be using.

Request headers: cURL allow ye to specify custom request headers to be sent with yer request. Ye can use the `-H` option to specify a header, such as `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` to specify the content type of yer request.

Request data: cURL allow ye to specify data to be sent with yer request, such as form data or a `JSON` payload. Ye can use the -d option to specify the data ye be sending.

> **Note** If ye be sending JSON data, ye should use the `--data-raw` option instead of the `-d` option. The `-d` option will escape the JSON payload, which will cause the request to fail.

Response headers: cURL allow ye to view the response headers that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-i` option to view the response headers.

Response body: cURL allow ye to view the response body that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-o` option to save the response body to a file, or ye can use the `-O` option to save the response body to a file with the same name as the file on the server.

I hope this helps you understand how cURL works and how a pirate might use it to make HTTP requests. Arrr!

> **Note** if ye ever get stuck use `curl cht.sh/:help` to get help

A typical cURL `GET` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

A typical cURL `POST` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

### **CI/CD**

CI/CD be a software development practice where code changes be automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows for faster and more frequent updates to a software application, as code changes be automatically deployed as soon as they pass testing. This can help to reduce the risk of deployments, as well as speed up the time it take for new features or bug fixes to reach users.

#### **Continuous Integration**

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration is then automatically built and tested to ensure that the code changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous integration as a way to keep your ship (the software application) in good repair. Instead of waiting until the end of a long voyage to fix any problems with the ship, continuous integration allows you to make small repairs and improvements as you go. By regularly integrating and testing code changes, you can catch and fix problems early, before they become bigger issues that could sink the ship. This helps to ensure that your ship is always ready to set sail and that you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) as they arise.

#### **Continuous Delivery**

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows for faster and more frequent updates to a software application, as code changes can be automatically deployed as soon as they pass testing. This can help to reduce the risk of deployments, as well as speed up the time it takes for new features or bug fixes to reach users.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous delivery as a way to quickly and efficiently get your ship (the software application) ready for battle. Instead of spending a lot of time preparing and repairing the ship before each voyage (deployment), continuous delivery allows you to make small, incremental changes to the ship as needed, so that it is always ready to set sail. This way, you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) and be better prepared for whatever the seas (your users) might throw your way.

It allows for the creation of powerful, flexible, and efficient tracing and monitoring tools, as well as the ability to write custom kernel modules without having to write any C code.

In a pirate theme, you could think of eBPF as a way to add new features to your ship (the Linux kernel). Instead of having to modify the ship's hull (the Linux kernel) to add new features, eBPF allows you to add new features by inserting new code into the ship's hull (the Linux kernel). This allows you to add new features without having to modify the ship's hull, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that maps human-readable domain names (such as "example.com") to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS helps to make it easier for people to access websites and other online resources, as it allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of having to remember complex numerical addresses.

In a pirate theme, you could think of DNS as a way to navigate the vast and often-treacherous seas of the internet. Just as a map helps a pirate to find their way from one island to another, DNS helps to guide internet users to the websites and online resources they are looking for. Instead of having to remember the exact location of each island (website), a pirate can simply consult their map (DNS) to find the right route.

DNS also helps to ensure that internet users can reach their destination even if the underlying landscape (IP addresses) changes. Just as a pirate might need to adjust their course if the winds or currents shift, DNS can automatically route internet users to the correct location even if the underlying IP addresses change. This helps to make the internet more reliable and accessible, even in the midst of constantly-changing conditions.

#### **Types of DNS Records**

There are several different types of DNS records that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. The most common types of DNS records are A records, which map a domain name to a single IP address, and CNAME records, which map a domain name to another domain name. Other types of DNS records include MX records, which map a domain name to an email server, and TXT records, which can be used to store arbitrary text data.

#### **Examples of DNS Records**

**A record:**

`pirate.com.      IN A      127.0.0.1`

This A record maps the domain name "pirate.com" to the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

**CNAME record:**

`pirateship.pirate.com.      IN CNAME      pirate.com.`

This CNAME record maps the domain name "pirateship.pirate.com" to the domain name "pirate.com".

**MX record:**

`pirate.com.      IN MX      10 mail.pirate.com.`

This MX record specifies that the mail server for the domain "pirate.com" is located at "mail.pirate.com". The number "10" is the preference value, which determines the priority of the mail server.

**NS record:**

`pirate.com.      IN NS      ns1.pirate.com.
pirate.com.      IN NS      ns2.pirate.com.`

These NS records specify the name servers for the domain "pirate.com".

#### **DNS servers**

Ahoy there! DNS servers be the computers that store the DNS records for a given domain. When a user tries to access a website, their computer will first query a DNS server to find the IP address for the requested domain. The DNS server will then return the IP address to the user's computer, which can then use the IP address to connect to the requested website.

#### **DNSSEC**

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) be a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that help to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and authentic. It does this by adding digital signatures to DNS records, which can be used to verify that the DNS records have not been tampered with. It also adds a mechanism for verifying that the DNS server that is responding to a query be the correct DNS server for the requested domain.

#### **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over HTTPS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

#### **DNS over TLS (DoT)**

DNS over TLS (DoT) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over TLS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

#### **DNSCrypt**

DNSCrypt be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private. It does this by encrypting DNS queries and responses using the NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library) encryption library.

#### **DNS Amplification Attacks**

DNS amplification attacks be a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic. They work by sending a large number of DNS queries to a DNS server, which will then respond to each query with a large amount of data. This can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic, which can cause the server to become overloaded and crash.

#### **Hosts file**

The hosts file be a file that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. It be typically located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux systems, but the exact location may vary depending on the operating system. The hosts file can be used to override the DNS records for a given domain, which can be useful for testing purposes.

### **Docker**

Arr matey, ye be askin' about Docker, the popular containerization software that be makin' it easier to ship, run, and manage applications.

Docker be usin' containers to package up an application with all of the parts it be needin' to run, such as libraries and dependencies, and ship it as one package. This be makin' it easier to run the application on any other machine, regardless of the specific environment or configuration.

To work with Docker, ye might be usin' the Docker Engine to build, run, and manage containers. Ye can build your own containers or use ones that other scallywags have built and shared. Ye can also use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications, makin' it easier to scale and manage them.

In terms of practical use, ye might be usin' Docker to set up a development environment for your application, or to package and deploy your application to production. Ye can also use Docker to run databases or other services that your application relies on.

So there ye have it, a brief overview of Docker and how ye might be workin' with it. I hope this be helpin' ye to understand this powerful tool for managing and running applications. Shiver me timbers!

#### **Install Docker**

GitHub be a great place for developers to store their code and track changes to it over time. It be also a great place to share code with other developers and collaborate on projects together. Ye can use GitHub to create new repositories for yer own projects, or ye can contribute to other people's projects by forking their repositories and submitting pull requests.

GitHub be a valuable resource for developers, as it be a place to find and share code, as well as collaborate with other developers on projects. It be also a great place to find open-source projects and contribute to them. I hope this helps ye understand what GitHub be and how it can be used by developers!

##### **GitHub sounds a litttle overwhelming. What be the basics?**

Ahoy, matey! As for GitHub, ye should be well-versed in the ways of version control and collaboration. This means having a strong understanding of Git and the GitHub platform, and being able to use them effectively to manage and track code changes.

Ye should be able to create and clone repositories, create branches, and make and merge pull requests. Ye should also be familiar with GitHub's collaboration features such as issues and projects, and know how to use them to work with other developers on a project.

In addition to these technical skills, it be important for ye to be able to communicate with clients and stakeholders about the benefits of using GitHub. Ye should be able to explain how GitHub can improve the collaboration and workflow of a development team in a way that is easy for non-technical folks to understand.

Finally, as a true GitHub professional, ye should be able to keep yer head in a crisis and be able to think on yer feet. Whether it be dealing with a sudden influx of pull requests or a merge conflict, ye should be able to think quickly and come up with solutions to keep yer ship sailing smoothly. So hoist the mainsail and get to work, matey!

#### **Getting Started with Git and GitHub**

Here be a few basic commands ye can use to get started with Git and GitHub:

You will need to have `git` configured on yer local machine. If ye don't have it installed, ye can install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To configure yer local machine, ye can use the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "[name]"
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```

- "I be needin' to initialize a new Git repository on me local machine, arrr!"

`git init`

- "I be needin' to add me changes to the Git staging area, arrr!"

`git add [file]`

- "I be needin' to commit me changes to the Git repository, arrr!"

`git commit -m "[commit message]"`

- "I be needin' to see the commit history of me repository, arrr!"

`git log`

- "I be needin' to clone a repository from GitHub to me local machine, arrr!"

`git clone [repository URL]`

- "I be needin' to push me changes to the remote repository on GitHub, arrr!"

`git push origin [branch]`

- "I be needin' to pull the latest changes from the remote repository on GitHub, arrr!"

`git pull origin [branch]`

- "It will pull or fetch the remote repository data into the local repo."

`ls -a .git`

- "It will show the hidden files that are created after initializing the Git."

`git status` 

- "It will show the status of the files that are newly created, modified or deleted."

`git add filename` OR `git add .`

- "This will add a particular or all the file data into the staging area and after that, the data will be committed into the Git."

`git commit -m "add a message"`

- "This command will commit the changes in the Git when you first add the files."

`git commit -am "add a message"`

- "This one command will add the file data into the staging area and it will also commit that data in the Git."

These be just a few of the basic commands ye can use to get started with Git and GitHub, matey. There be many more commands and features available, so don't be afraid to explore and learn more. Just watch out for those scurvy Git merge conflicts!

##### **What if I get stuck?**

Ye might find yerself stuck in a few common scenarios from time to time. Here are a few examples and how ye might be able to get yerself out of them:

- **Merge conflicts:** If ye are trying to merge two branches and there are conflicts between the code in each branch, GitHub will not allow the merge to go through. To resolve this, ye will need to manually edit the code to resolve the conflicts. Once ye have done so, ye can commit the changes and try merging the branches again.

- **Accidentally deleted a file:** If ye have accidentally deleted a file from a repository, ye can try using GitHub's "Restore this file" feature to restore it. This will only work if the file has not been permanently deleted from the repository's history.

- **Accidentally committed sensitive information:** If ye have accidentally committed sensitive information such as a password or an API key to a repository, ye will need to remove it as soon as possible. To do this, ye can use the "git filter-branch" command to remove the sensitive information from the repository's history.

**Collaborator is not responding:** If ye are working with a collaborator on a project and they are not responding to your requests or pull requests, ye can try reaching out to them through other channels such as email or a messaging app. If that doesn't work, ye can try reaching out to a mutual contact or the repository owner to see if they can help resolve the issue.

I hope these tips help ye navigate the choppy waters of GitHub, matey!

##### **Get involved in open-source projects**

[EddieHub](https://eddiehub.org)

If ye be interested in getting involved with open source software, there be many ways ye can do so. Here are a few ideas:

Find a project that interests ye and start using it. As ye use the software, ye may come across bugs or have ideas for improvements. If so, ye can submit an issue or pull request to the project's repository on GitHub to let the maintainers know.

Contribute to an existing project. Many open source projects are always looking for new contributors. Ye can look for projects that are looking for help on websites such as GitHub, OpenCollective, or UpForGrabs.

Start yer own open source project. If ye have an idea for a project that ye would like to see exist, ye can start yer own open source project and invite others to contribute. Ye can host yer project on a platform such as GitHub and use a license such as the MIT or Apache License to make it open source.

Join a community. There are many open source communities ye can join to connect with other like-minded individuals and learn more about open source. Ye can find communities on websites such as GitHub, Reddit, or Meetup.

I hope these ideas help ye set sail on yer open source journey, matey!

##### **Eddie Jaoude**

![Eddie Jaoude](images/eddiejaoude.jpg)

[Eddie Jaoude](https://eddiejaoude.io)

Eddie Jaoude be a software engineer and open source enthusiast. He be the founder of EddieHub, a community of open source contributors. He be also the host of the "Open Source Show" podcast, where he interviews open source contributors and maintainers.

##### **EddieHub and LinkFree**

[EddieHub](https://www.eddiehub.org) | [LinkFree](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io)

Avast ye, open source software be a type of software that be freely available for any scurvy dog to use, modify, and distribute. This be in contrast to proprietary software, which be owned by a company or individual and be not freely available for modification or distribution.

There be several benefits to using open source software. One of the main benefits be that it allows any pirate to access and modify the source code. This means that individuals and organizations can use the software for their own purposes, and if they have the technical skills, they can also make changes to the software to suit their specific needs. This flexibility be not possible with proprietary software, which be typically closed off and not available for modification.

Another benefit of open source software be that it often has a strong community of scallywags who contribute to the project. These contributors can include developers, users, and enthusiasts who collaborate on the project and share their knowledge and expertise. This can be a great learning opportunity for those who be just starting out in tech, as they can gain valuable experience by contributing to an open source project and working with others in the community.

Supporting open source projects like LinkFree be important because it helps to ensure that the project can continue to be maintained and developed. It can also help to foster a strong and vibrant community of pirates around the project, which can lead to more collaboration and innovation.

Joining a community like EddieHub can also be a great way to get involved in the tech world and connect with other salty dogs who have similar interests. It can provide opportunities to learn from others, share your own knowledge and experiences, and potentially find job opportunities or collaborate on projects. Overall, participating in a community like EddieHub can be a valuable and rewarding experience for those just starting out in tech. So hoist up the mainsail and join the crew at EddieHub, matey!

### **Homebrew**

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

Homebrew is a free and open-source package management system for macOS and Linux that simplifies the installation of software on those operating systems. It allows users to install and manage software packages written in a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Go, as well as libraries and other dependencies needed to run those programs.

Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew that is designed to run on Linux systems. It provides the same functionality as Homebrew, but is specifically tailored for use on Linux systems. It is written in Ruby and can be used to install and manage software packages on a wide range of Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.

To install Homebrew on macOS, you can open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

To install Linuxbrew on a Linux system, you can run the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Both Homebrew and Linuxbrew use a command-line interface to install and manage packages. Once installed, you can use the brew command to search for and install packages, as well as manage and update the packages you have installed.

For example, to search for a package called "treasuremap," you can run the following command:

```bash
brew search treasuremap
```

To install a package called "treasuremap," you can run the following command:

```bash
brew install treasuremap
```

### **HTML**

Ahoy matey! HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for marking up text files to indicate how they should be displayed in a web browser. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, HTML helps web browsers interpret and display the content of a web page.

HTML uses a set of predefined tags to structure and format the content of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. For example, the "p" tag is used to define a paragraph, and the "h1" tag is used to define a level 1 heading.

Here's an example of some basic HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Pirate's Cove</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Pirate's Cove</h1>
    <p>Ahoy matey! Welcome to the finest pirate's hideout on the internet.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code defines a simple web page with a level 1 heading and a paragraph of text. The "html" tag indicates the start and end of the HTML document, the "head" tag contains information about the document, and the "body" tag contains the visible content of the page.

HTML is just one part of the puzzle when it comes to building a website. Other technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, are often used in conjunction with HTML to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

I hope this helps you understand what HTML is and how a pirate might use it to build their own website. Arrr!

#### **Meta tags**

Ahoy matey! Meta tags are a set of HTML tags that be used to provide information about a web page to web browsers and search engines. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, meta tags help web browsers and search engines interpret and display the content of a web page.

Meta tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. For example, the "meta" tag is used to define a meta tag, and the "title" tag is used to define the title of a web page.

Here's an example of some basic meta tags:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Pirate's Cove</title>
```

#### **Is HTML a programming language?**

HTML is not a programming language, but it is a markup language. A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign meaning to the text. HTML is used to define the structure and content of a web page, and is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

#### **CSS**

Ahoy matey! CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, CSS helps web browsers interpret and display the content of a web page in a specific way.

CSS uses a set of rules, called "styles", to define the appearance of the elements on a web page. These styles can be applied to specific elements on the page, or to groups of elements using selectors.

Here's an example of some basic CSS code:

```css
body {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #ff0000;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

This code defines the styles for the `body`, `h1`, and `p` elements on a web page. The `body` style sets the background color to `black`, the text color to `white`, and the font family to `sans-serif`. The `h1` style sets the text color to `red`, and the `p` style sets the font size to `16` pixels and the line height to `1.5`.

CSS can be used to style a wide variety of elements on a web page, including text, images, and layout. It can also be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

I hope this helps you understand what CSS is and how a pirate might use it to style their website. Arrr!

### **HTTP**

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data on the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to transfer data from a server to a client, or vice versa.

In a pirate theme, you could think of HTTP as the system that allows pirates to send and receive messages and information as they sail the seas of the internet. Just like a pirate ship uses a flag to communicate with other ships, a website uses HTTP to communicate with a client's web browser. When you enter a website's address into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which includes the content of the website.

HTTP is just one of many protocols that make the internet work, but it is an important one because it allows us to access and interact with websites and other online resources. Arrr!

#### **HTTP error codes**

HTTP error codes are a set of standardized codes that are used to indicate the status of an HTTP request. They are returned by the server in the HTTP response, and can be used to determine whether a request was successful or not.

Here are some of the most common HTTP error codes:

- 200 OK - The request was successful
- 301 Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been moved permanently
- 302 Found - The requested resource has been moved temporarily
- 400 Bad Request - The request was invalid
- 401 Unauthorized - The request requires authentication
- 403 Forbidden - The server refused to fulfill the request
- 404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found
- 500 Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server
- 503 Service Unavailable - The server is currently unavailable

For a bit of a laugh, here is an image you'll see as a 404 error page on some of my applications: (not to be taken seriously)

![404](images/404.png)

Here are some more obscure HTTP error codes:

- 418 I'm a teapot - The server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot
- 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons - The requested resource is unavailable due to legal reasons

#### **HTTP methods**

HTTP methods are a set of standardized methods that are used to indicate the action that should be performed for a given resource. They are used in the HTTP request, and can be used to determine what action should be performed on the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP methods:

- **GET** - Retrieve a resource
- **POST** - Create a resource
- **PUT** - Update a resource
- **DELETE** - Delete a resource

HTTP methods can also be used to indicate the type of data that is being sent in the request. For example, the `Content-Type` header can be used to indicate that the request body contains JSON data.

Here are some of the most common `Content-Type` values:

- `application/json` - JSON data
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - Form data
- `multipart/form-data` - Form data with file uploads

#### **HTTP headers**

HTTP headers are a set of standardized fields that are used to send additional information with an HTTP request or response. They are used to provide additional context about the request or response, and can be used to pass additional information between the client and the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP headers:

- `Accept` - The types of data that the client can accept
- `Accept-Encoding` - The types of data encoding that the client can accept
- `Accept-Language` - The languages that the client can accept
- `Authorization` - The credentials that the client can use to authenticate
- `Cache-Control` - The caching behavior that the client can accept
- `Content-Length` - The length of the request body
- `Content-Type` - The type of data that is contained in the request body
- `Cookie` - The cookies that the client can send to the server
- `Host` - The host name of the server
- `User-Agent` - The user agent that the client is using

HTTP headers can also be used to pass additional information between the client and the server. For example, the `X-Forwarded-For` header can be used to pass the IP address of the client to the server.

#### **HTTPS**

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) can be thought of as a way to secure communication between two parties. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet, and it is designed to provide an additional layer of security on top of the regular HTTP protocol.

Imagine that two pirates are trying to send messages to each other over the internet, but they are worried that their messages might be intercepted by other pirates or other parties. To secure their communication, they could use HTTPS. When they use HTTPS, their messages are encrypted, which means that they are transformed into a code that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient. This makes it much harder for anyone else to intercept and read the messages, as they would need to have the key to decrypt the code.

In addition to encryption, HTTPS also provides authentication, which means that it can verify the identity of the sender and the recipient. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third party tries to intercept and manipulate the communication between two parties.

Overall, HTTPS is a useful tool for pirates (or anyone else) who want to keep their communication private and secure. It can help protect against interception and tampering, and it can also provide reassurance that the messages are actually coming from the intended sender.

#### **API (Application Programming Interface)**

An API (Application Programming Interface) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of an API as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

APIs are often used to retrieve data from a server, but they can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

##### **GraphQL (Graph Query Language)**

GraphQL (Graph Query Language) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of GraphQL as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

GraphQL is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

##### **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

REST (Representational State Transfer) can be thought of as a set of standardized principles that are used to design web applications. It is a way to design web applications so that they can be easily accessed and used by clients.

REST is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

##### **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

SOAP is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

### **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure, their crew, and their adventures on the high seas.

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that is used to transmit data between a server and a client, or between different systems. It is based on the JavaScript programming language, but can be used with many other programming languages as well.

JSON is a popular choice for storing and exchanging data because it is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for computers to parse and generate. It is often used to send data from a server to a web page, or to store data in a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB.

To use JSON, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on key-value pairs and lists of values. A key-value pair consists of a unique key and a value, separated by a colon. A list of values is an ordered collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

JSON is a powerful and flexible tool that is widely used in modern web development, and is an important part of a pirate's arsenal. Arrr!

### **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) can be thought of as a communication protocol that is used to transmit messages between devices on a network. It is often used to send error messages or to request information from other devices.

On a Linux system, ICMP is used for a variety of purposes, including:

**Error reporting:** ICMP can be used to send error messages when there is a problem with a network connection or when a packet of data cannot be delivered.

**Network diagnosis:** ICMP can be used to request information from other devices on the network, such as the round-trip time of a packet or the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a link. This can be useful for diagnosing network problems and optimizing network performance.

**Network discovery:** ICMP can be used to send "ping" messages, which are used to determine if a device is reachable on the network. This can be useful for detecting network outages or for verifying network connectivity.

You might imagine that ICMP is a useful tool for pirates to keep track of their network and diagnose problems. It allows them to communicate with other devices on the network and request information that can help them understand how the network is functioning.

An example of troubleshooting a network problem using ICMP might look like this:

1. A pirate sends a ping message to a device on the network.
2. The device responds with an ICMP echo reply message.
3. The pirate receives the echo reply message and uses it to determine the round-trip time of the packet.
4. The pirate uses the round-trip time to diagnose the problem and determine the cause of the network outage.
5. The pirate fixes the problem and the network is restored.
6. The pirate sends another ping message to the device to verify that the network is working again.
7. The device responds with an ICMP echo reply message.

### **Infrastructure as Code**

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way to define and manage your infrastructure and its dependencies using code, rather than manually configuring resources through a graphical user interface. This allows you to version control your infrastructure, automate the provisioning and management of resources, and apply testing and deployment practices similar to those used in software development.

In a pirate theme, you could think of infrastructure as code as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships and their various systems and equipment. Instead of manually configuring and repairing each ship's sails, masts, and engines, you could use code to define how these components should be set up and configured. This would allow you to automate the process of building and repairing your ships, as well as make it easier to scale your fleet as needed.

By using infrastructure as code, you can also more easily track and manage changes to your ships' systems and equipment over time, as well as roll back any changes that might cause problems. This can help you to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

### **IP Addresses**

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) can be thought of as a unique identifier that is assigned to each device that is connected to the internet. It is a numerical label that is used to identify a specific device, and it is similar to a physical address or a phone number.

Imagine that a group of pirates are all connected to the same network, and they want to communicate with each other over the internet. In order to send messages to a specific pirate, they need to know the pirate's IP address. Just like how a physical address tells you where a house is located, an IP address tells you where a device is located on the internet.

IP addresses are usually assigned by internet service providers (ISPs) or network administrators, and they can be either static (meaning they never change) or dynamic (meaning they are assigned temporarily and can change over time).

You might imagine that each pirate has a unique IP address that they use to communicate with other pirates over the internet. They might also use IP addresses to access websites and other online resources, just like how people use IP addresses in the real world.

#### **What is an IP made up of?**

Ahoy matey! An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, an IP address helps devices on a network find and communicate with each other.

An IP address consists of four numbers separated by periods, and each number can range from 0 to 255. For example, an IP address might look like this: 192.168.1.1

These four numbers represent different parts of the IP address, known as octets. Each octet is a group of 8 bits, and together, the four octets make up a 32-bit number.

The first octet is used to identify the network that the device is a part of. The remaining three octets are used to identify the specific device within that network.

There are two main versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most widely used version and uses 32-bit numbers, as described above. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit numbers and allows for a much larger number of unique IP addresses.

To understand an IP address, it's important to know the difference between a public and a private IP address. A public IP address is a unique address that is assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is used to identify the device on the Internet. A private IP address, on the other hand, is used to identify devices within a private network, such as a home or office network. Private IP addresses are not unique and are usually assigned by the router on the network.

I hope this helps you understand how IP addresses work and how a pirate might use them to navigate the vast ocean of the Internet. Arrr!

### **JavaScript**

Ahoy matey! Are ye interested in learning about JavaScript, the programming language used to make websites and web applications more interactive and dynamic?

JavaScript is a popular, cross-platform programming language that is primarily used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript is often used in combination with these other technologies to build complex web applications and sites.

JavaScript code is usually written in text editors and then run in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. The code can be written directly in an HTML file, or it can be linked to an external JavaScript file that is then referenced in the HTML file.

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the structure of a website's HTML and CSS. This allows JavaScript to modify the appearance and content of a website in real-time, as well as respond to user input and interactivity.

JavaScript is also an object-oriented programming language, meaning that it is based on the concept of "objects" that have properties and methods. These objects can be used to represent real-world concepts, such as a person or a car, and can be manipulated and controlled using the JavaScript language.

I hope that helps ye get a better understanding of JavaScript, matey! If ye have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.

### **Kubernetes**

Kubernetes (also known as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps to provide a consistent and reliable environment for running applications, regardless of where they are deployed.

In a pirate theme, you could think of Kubernetes as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships (the containerized applications). Instead of having to manually deploy and manage each ship individually, Kubernetes allows you to automate the process and scale your fleet as needed. This can help you to be more efficient and responsive, as you can deploy new ships or make changes to existing ones more quickly and easily.

Kubernetes also helps to ensure that your ships are running smoothly and reliably, by providing features like automatic self-healing, rolling updates, and resource management. This can help to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

### **Latency**

Latency is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another. In a pirate theme, you could think of latency as the time it takes for a message to travel from one pirate to another.

Latency is an important concept in computer networking, and it is often used to describe the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from one device to another. Latency is measured in milliseconds (ms), and it is usually measured using a tool called a ping.

Latency is an important metric to consider when designing a network, as it can affect the performance of applications and services. For example, if a user is experiencing high latency, they may experience slow loading times or poor video quality when streaming a video.

Latency can also be affected by the distance between two devices, as well as the type of network connection that is being used. For example, a wireless connection will typically have higher latency than a wired connection.

### **Logging**

Logging on a Linux system can be thought of as a way for pirates to keep track of what is happening on their network. Logging is the process of recording events and activities that occur on a computer system, and it is a useful tool for diagnosing problems, tracking changes, and detecting security breaches.

On a Linux system, logging is typically managed by a program called syslog. Syslog is a system daemon that collects and stores log messages from various sources, such as the operating system, applications, and network devices. The syslog daemon writes the log messages to a file or sends them to a remote server, where they can be accessed and analyzed by the pirates.

There are several different types of log messages that can be recorded on a Linux system, including system logs, application logs, and security logs. System logs contain information about the operating system and system-level events, such as system startup and shutdown, kernel messages, and system errors. Application logs contain information about specific applications and their activities, such as user actions and error messages. Security logs contain information about security-related events, such as failed login attempts and system access.

Logging can be a useful tool for pirates to monitor their network and keep track of what is happening on their systems. It can help them identify problems, track changes, and detect security breaches, all of which are important for keeping their network running smoothly and securely.

#### **Logrotate**

Logrotate is a utility that can be used to manage log files on a Linux system. It can be used to rotate, compress, and remove log files, as well as send log files to a remote server.

Logrotate is typically configured using a configuration file called logrotate.conf, which is located in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. This file contains a list of log files that should be rotated, as well as the rotation schedule and other options.

Logrotate can be used to rotate log files on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. It can also be used to compress log files, which can help to save disk space. Logrotate can also be used to remove old log files, which can help to keep the system clean and organized.

### **Monitoring**

Monitoring on a Linux system can be thought of as a way for pirates to keep track of the performance and status of their systems. Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data about a system's resources and activities, and it is a useful tool for identifying problems, optimizing performance, and detecting security breaches.

There are many different tools and techniques that can be used to monitor a Linux system, including:

**System logs:** Pirates can use system logs to keep track of events and activities that occur on their system. System logs contain information about the operating system, applications, and network devices, and they can be used to identify problems, track changes, and detect security breaches.

**System utilities:** Pirates can use system utilities such as top, ps, and free to monitor the performance of their system in real-time. These utilities can provide information about the CPU, memory, and disk usage of their system, as well as the processes that are running.

**Network monitoring:** Pirates can use tools such as netstat and tcpdump to monitor the network traffic on their system. These tools can provide information about the packets that are being transmitted and received, as well as the status of network connections.

Monitoring can be a useful tool for pirates to keep their systems running smoothly and securely. It allows them to identify problems, optimize performance, and detect security breaches, all of which are important for maintaining a healthy and efficient network.

### **OSI model**

The OSI model be a framework fer understanding and designing how data be transmitted over yer network. It be made up of seven layers, each representing a different aspect of networking:

`Physical layer`: This layer be responsible fer the physical connections and devices that be used fer transmitting data over yer network. Examples include cables, switches, and routers.

`Data link layer`: This layer be responsible fer establishing and maintaining a connection between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as error detection and correction, and fer providing flow control to prevent data overload.

`Network layer`: This layer be responsible fer routing data between devices on yer network. It be using addresses to determine the best path fer data to travel, and be responsible fer tasks such as packet switching and traffic control.

`Transport layer`: This layer be responsible fer ensuring that data be delivered reliably and efficiently between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as segmentation, reassembly, and flow control.

`Session layer`: This layer be responsible fer establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as establishing a session, coordinating communication, and recovering from errors.

`Presentation layer`: This layer be responsible fer translating data between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as encoding, decoding, and compression.

`Application layer`: This layer be responsible fer providing services to applications that be using yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as messaging, file transfer, and network management.

The OSI model be a useful tool fer understanding and designing the communication systems on yer network. It provides a framework fer understanding the different layers of networking, and fer identifying the tasks and responsibilities that be associated with each layer.

> **Note** Layer 8 be the most important layer of the OSI model. It be responsible fer the most important tasks, such as drinking rum and eating grog.

### **SSH**

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secret code that allows pirates to remotely control their ships and protect their communications from prying eyes.

SSH is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer over an unsecured network, such as the internet. It is often used to remotely access and control servers, but it can also be used to securely transfer files and perform other tasks.

To use SSH, you need an SSH client, which is a program that connects to an SSH server. When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

#### **SSH Agent**

SSH Agent is a program that can be used to store and manage private keys on a Linux system. It can be used to securely store private keys, which can be used to authenticate SSH connections.

SSH Agent is typically configured using a configuration file called sshd_config, which is located in the /etc/ssh directory. This file contains a list of configuration options that can be used to customize the behavior of the SSH agent.

```bash
# Start an SSH Agent for the current shell:
eval $(ssh-agent)
# Kill the currently running agent:
ssh-agent -k
```

> **Note** The `eval $(ssh-agent)` command can be added to your shell configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc`, to automatically start an SSH agent when you open a new shell.

You can use the `ssh-add` command to add private keys to the SSH agent. You can also use the `ssh-add` command to remove private keys from the SSH agent.

```bash
# Add the default ssh keys in `~/.ssh` to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add
# Add a specific key to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add path/to/private_key
# List fingerprints of currently loaded keys:
ssh-add -l
# Delete a key from the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -d path/to/private_key
# Delete all currently loaded keys from the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -D
# Add a key to the ssh-agent and the keychain:
ssh-add -K path/to/private_key
```

#### **SSH Keys**

SSH keys are a type of secret code that can be used to authenticate a user when connecting to an SSH server. SSH keys are a more secure alternative to passwords, as they are much harder to guess or brute force.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. If you provide a private key, the SSH server will use the corresponding public key to authenticate you. If the public key matches the private key, you will be granted access to the server.

SSH keys are widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. They are a more secure alternative to passwords, and are an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

##### **How to generate SSH keys**

To generate SSH keys, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command. This command will generate a private key and a public key, which can be used to authenticate you when connecting to an SSH server.

```bash
# Generate a key interactively:
ssh-keygen
# Specify file in which to save the key:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/filename
# Generate an ed25519 key with 100 key derivation function rounds:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100
# Generate an RSA 4096-bit key with email as a comment:
ssh-keygen -t dsa|ecdsa|ed25519|rsa -b 4096 -C "comment|email"
# Remove the keys of a host from the known_hosts file (useful when a known host has a new key):
ssh-keygen -R remote_host
# Retrieve the fingerprint of a key in MD5 Hex:
ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ~/.ssh/filename
# Change the password of a key:
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/filename
```

#### **SSH Port Forwarding**

This be makin' it more difficult for third parties to intercept or tamper with the communication between the server and client.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

In the context of nginx, ye might be usin' an SSL certificate to secure the connection between nginx and the clients that be connectin' to it, such as web browsers. To do this, ye will need to obtain an SSL certificate and configure nginx to use it.

There be a few different types of SSL certificates, each with its own level of validation and security. Some be more expensive and time-consuming to obtain, but offer a higher level of trust and security.

I hope this be helpin' ye to understand how SSL certificates be workin' and how ye might be usin' them with nginx. Ahoy!

##### **Self-signed SSL Certificates**

Self-signed SSL certificates be a type of digital certificate that be used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a client, such as a web browser.

### **Streaming**

You could think of streaming as a way for pirates to continuously receive updates and information from other ships as they sail the seas of the internet.

In software engineering, streaming refers to the process of continuously transmitting data from a server to a client, or vice versa, without the need to download and save the entire dataset upfront. This allows the client to receive and process the data as it is being transmitted, rather than waiting for the entire dataset to be transferred before beginning to process it.

Streaming is commonly used for media, such as music and video, but it can also be used for other types of data, such as financial data or social media updates. It allows users to access and process large amounts of data in real-time, rather than having to wait for it to be transferred and stored locally.

Streaming can be implemented using a variety of technologies and protocols, such as HTTP streaming, WebSockets, and WebRTC. It is an important part of modern software engineering, and is a valuable tool for pirates as they navigate the choppy waters of the internet. Arrr!

### **Subnet**

A subnet (short for "subnetwork") can be thought of as a smaller network that is contained within a larger network. It is a way to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable parts.

Imagine that a group of pirates have set up a network to communicate with each other over the internet. The network might be very large, with many different pirates and devices connected to it. To make it easier to manage and organize the network, the pirates might decide to create subnets.

For example, they might create a subnet for pirates who are located in the same geographical area, or they might create a subnet for pirates who are working on the same project. This would allow them to easily communicate with each other and share resources, while also keeping their communication separate from other parts of the network.

In a real-world context, subnets are often used to improve the efficiency of networks by reducing the amount of traffic that needs to be routed between different parts of the network. They can also be used to improve security by isolating different parts of the network from each other.

#### **Subnet mask**

A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to determine which devices are part of the same subnet.

Imagine that a group of pirates are using subnets to divide their network into smaller, more manageable parts. Each pirate has an IP address that is assigned to their device, and the subnet mask is used to identify which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host.

For example, if the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", it means that the first three octets (groups of 8 bits) of the IP address represent the network portion, while the last octet represents the host portion. Using this information, the pirates can determine which devices are part of the same subnet and can communicate with each other directly, without having to go through a router.

In the real-world, subnet masks are used to divide networks into smaller, more manageable parts and to improve the efficiency of communication between devices on a network. They are an important part of the IP addressing system, and they are used in many different types of networks, including pirate networks.

#### **How to calculate a subnet mask**

Determine the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create. Consider factors such as the number of pirates and devices that will be connected to the network, the geographical location of the pirates, and the types of resources that will be shared on the network.

Select a subnet mask that is appropriate for your network. A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. The subnet mask will depend on the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create.

Calculate the subnet address for each subnet. To do this, you will need to use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device on the network. The subnet address is the portion of the IP address that belongs to the network, as identified by the subnet mask.

Assign an IP address to each device on the network. The IP address should be unique for each device, and it should include the subnet address for the subnet that the device is part of.

For example, let's say that you have a network with 100 pirates, and you want to create 10 subnets with 10 pirates each. You might select a subnet mask of "255.255.255.0", which would allow you to create up to 256 subnets. To calculate the subnet address for each subnet, you would use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device. For example, if the IP address of a device is "192.168.1.1", and the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", the subnet address would be "192.168.1.0".

#### **Subnetting Cheatsheet**

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, called subnets. Subnetting allows an organization to break up its network into smaller, more manageable pieces, and assign specific subnets to different departments or locations.

##### **Subnet Mask**

A subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number that is used to divide the IP address into the network portion and the host portion. The subnet mask is used to determine which portion of the IP address belongs to the network and which portion belongs to the host.

The subnet mask is usually written in the form of an IP address, such as `255.255.255.0`, but it is actually a binary number. To determine the subnet mask in binary, each octet (the numbers separated by periods) is converted to binary:

```bash
`255.255.255.0
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
```

The subnet mask is used in conjunction with the IP address to determine which portion of the IP address belongs to the network and which portion belongs to the host.

##### **CIDR Notation**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a standard syntax for representing IP addresses and their associated subnet masks. In CIDR notation, the subnet mask is represented by a slash followed by a number, called the prefix length.

For example, the subnet mask `255.255.255.0` can be written in CIDR notation as `/24`, because the first 24 bits are set to 1 and the remaining 8 bits are set to 0.

##### **Subnetting a Network**

To subnet a network, the network administrator must first determine the number of subnets needed and the number of hosts per subnet. The network administrator can then use the following formula to determine the subnet mask:

```bash
`2^n - 2 = total number of hosts per subnet`
```

Where `n` is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion of the IP address to create the subnets.

For example, if a network administrator needs to create 8 subnets, each with 30 hosts, the following steps can be taken:

1. Determine the number of bits needed to create 8 subnets: `log2 8 = 3`
2. Determine the number of bits needed to support 30 hosts per subnet: `log2 30 = 5`
3. Add the number of bits needed for the subnets and the number of bits needed for the hosts: `3 + 5 = 8`
4. Determine the subnet mask by setting the first `8` bits to 1 and the remaining bits to 0: `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`
5. Convert the subnet mask to CIDR notation: `/23`

##### **Subnetting Examples**

Here are some more examples of how to subnet a network using the subnet mask and CIDR notation:

- To create 16 subnets, each with 4 hosts:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000`
  - CIDR notation: `/28`
- To create 32 subnets, each with 2 hosts:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000`
  - CIDR notation: `/29`
- To create 64 subnets, each with 1 host:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100`
  - CIDR notation: `/30`

##### **Subnetting Practice**

Here are some practice problems to help you get familiar with subnetting:

1. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`?
2. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000`?
3. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`?

**Answers:**

1. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`, you can create 4 subnets, each with 2048 hosts.
2. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000`, you can create 8 subnets, each with 1024 hosts.
3. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`, you can create 16 subnets, each with 512 hosts.

![TCP & UDP meme](images/tcp-udp.png)

### **TCP/IP**

TCP/IP be a suite of networking protocols that be used to connect devices on the internet. It be the foundation of the internet, and it be what allow devices to communicate with each other and exchange data over the network.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) be a protocol that be used to establish and maintain connections between devices on the network. It be responsible for dividing data into smaller packets and sending them over the network, and it be also responsible for ensuring that the packets be delivered to the destination reliably.

IP (Internet Protocol) be a protocol that be used to route packets of data between devices on the network. It be responsible for assigning unique addresses to devices on the network and routing packets to the correct destination based on these addresses.

Together, TCP and IP be the backbone of the internet, and they be what allow devices to communicate and exchange data with each other. So hoist the mainsail and set course for TCP/IP mastery! With a solid understanding of these protocols, ye'll be well on yer way to becoming a skilled network administrator. Arrrr!

### **UDP**

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a communication protocol that is used to transmit data over networks, such as the internet. It is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than protocols that require a connection to be established, but it also means that data transmitted using UDP is less reliable, as there is no guarantee that the data will be received by the intended recipient.

You might imagine UDP as a way for pirates to send messages to each other without having to go through the trouble of setting up a formal communication channel. They could simply send a message using UDP and hope that it gets to the intended recipient, much like a pirate sending a message in a bottle and hoping it reaches its destination.

### **YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)**

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure maps and their plans for future raids.

In software engineering and devops, YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files and in applications that need to process data from multiple sources. It is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and is often used as an alternative to XML or JSON.

To use YAML, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on indentation and key-value pairs. A key-value pair consists of a unique key, followed by a colon, followed by the value. Indentation is used to indicate the hierarchy of the data, with each level of indentation representing a new level in the hierarchy.

YAML is a popular choice for configuration files because it is easy to read and write, and it is flexible enough to support a wide variety of data structures. It is also often used in devops tools, such as Ansible and Docker, to define infrastructure as code.

To use YAML effectively as a pirate, you should familiarize yourself with its syntax and conventions, and understand how it is used in the tools and technologies you are working with. Arrr!

### **Zsh**

Arrr matey! Zsh, also known as the "Z shell," is a Unix shell and command-line interpreter that you can use on your Linux system. It's similar to other shells like the Bourne shell (sh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash), but it offers additional features and functionality that can make it easier and more efficient to use.

To get started with zsh on your Linux system, you'll need to install it first. You can do this using your system's package manager, such as "apt" on Debian-based systems or "yum" on Red Hat-based systems. For example, you might run a command like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zsh -y
```

Once zsh is installed, you can start using it by launching a terminal window and entering `zsh` at the command prompt. This will launch the zsh shell, and you can start entering commands just like you would with any other shell.

You can also set zsh as your default shell, so that it will be launched automatically whenever you open a terminal window. To do this, you'll need to use the `chsh` command and specify the path to the zsh executable. For example:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

I hope this helps get you started with zsh on your Linux system, matey! Let me know if you have any other questions.

#### **Oh My Zsh**

Oh My Zsh is a popular open-source project that helps users configure and customize the Z shell (zsh). It provides a variety of themes, plugins, and features that can make it easier to use zsh and add additional functionality to your terminal.

To use Oh My Zsh, you'll need to install it on your system. You can do this by following the instructions:

- Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- Follow the prompts to install Oh My Zsh.
- Once the installation is complete, you can start using Oh My Zsh by launching a terminal window and entering `zsh` at the command prompt.

Once you have Oh My Zsh installed, you can start using it by launching a terminal window and entering "zsh" at the command prompt. This will launch the zsh shell with Oh My Zsh configured, and you'll see a variety of additional features and options available to you.

You can customize Oh My Zsh by modifying the configuration file located at "~/.zshrc" and selecting different themes or plugins to use. There are many themes and plugins available, so you can choose the ones that best suit your needs and preferences.

## **Chapter Three: Your first day as a pirate**

We are going to get a little bit hands on here. We are going to create a new project and we are going to create a new file. We are going to call this file `index.html`. We are going to open this file in our text editor. We are going to add some HTML to this file. We are going to save this file. We are going to open this file in our browser. We are going to see the result of our work. We are going to be very happy. We are going to celebrate. We are going to go to the pub. We are going to have a drink. We are going to have a good time. We are going to be pirates.

Just kidding. Although that is a great way to start, we should do a little bit more than that.

1. **Setting Sail:** It be time to set sail! In the terminal, try using the `ls` command to list the files and directories in the current directory, and the `cd` command to navigate to different directories. Can ye find yer way to the ship's hold?

2. **Finding Yer Way Home:** After a long voyage, it be nice to have a place to call home. In the terminal, try using the `echo` command to print out yer home directory, and the `cd` command to navigate to it. Can ye find a way to create a new directory and move a file into it?

3. **Managing Yer Crew:** A good captain be able to manage their crew and keep track of who be on board. In the terminal, try using the `whoami` command to see what user ye be logged in as, and the `groups` command to see what groups ye be a member of. Can ye find out who else be on board the ship?

4. **Navigating the Seas:** No voyage be complete without a good map! In the terminal, try using the `man` command to read the documentation for different commands and learn how to use them. Can ye find out how to use the `grep` command to search for a specific word in a file?

5. **Arranging Yer Crew:** A captain be nothing without a well-organized crew. In the terminal, try using the `sort` command to sort a list of names, and the `uniq` command to remove duplicates. Can ye find a way to count the number of unique names in the list?

6. **Setting Up Anchor:** When it be time to rest, ye need to know how to set anchor. In the terminal, try using the `touch` command to create a new file, and the `rm` command to delete a file. Can ye find a way to rename a file?

7. **Sending Messages in a Bottle:** When ye be out at sea, ye need to find ways to communicate with the rest of the world. In the terminal, try using the `mail` command to send a message to yerself or another user on the ship. Can ye find out how to attach a file to the message?

8. **Finding Yer Way Around the Ship:** The first thing ye need to do is get yer bearings and learn how to navigate around the ship. In the terminal, try using the `pwd` command to see what directory ye be in, and the `ls` command to see what files and directories be in that directory. Can ye find yer way to the main deck?

9. **Raising the Anchor:** When it be time to set sail again, ye need to know how to raise anchor. In the terminal, try using the `chmod` command to change the permissions on a file or directory, and the `chown` command to change the owner of a file or directory. Can ye find a way to change the group ownership of a file or directory?

10. **Sending Signals:** When ye need to get someone's attention, ye need to know how to send a signal. In the terminal, try using the `kill` command to send a signal to a running process, and the `ps` command to list the processes running on the ship. Can ye find a way to stop a process from running?

### **Common problems**

Here are a few examples of common problems you might face when working with Linux, along with some possible solutions in a pirate theme:

1. **The Ship Be Sinking!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "out of memory." This be a problem because yer ship doesn't have enough memory to run all the programs ye be trying to use. To fix this problem, ye can try closing some programs or processes that be using a lot of memory, or ye can try adding more memory to yer ship.

2. **The Ship Be Adrift!:** Ye be trying to run a program, but ye keep getting a message saying "command not found." This be a problem because yer ship doesn't know where to find the program ye be trying to run. To fix this problem, ye can try using the which command to see where the program be installed, or ye can try adding the directory where the program be installed to yer PATH environment variable.

3. **The Ship Be Under Attack!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "permission denied." This be a problem because yer ship be trying to access a file or directory that ye don't have permission to access. To fix this problem, ye can try using the chmod command to change the permissions on the file or directory, or ye can try using the sudo command to run the program as the superuser.

4. **The Ship Be Taking on Water!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "disk full." This be a problem because yer ship's hard drive be full and ye don't have any more space to store yer files. To fix this problem, ye can try deleting some files that ye don't need anymore, or ye can try adding a new hard drive to yer ship.

I hope these examples give ye an idea of some common problems ye might face when working with Linux, and how ye might go about solving them.

### **Initiation**

Ye be now ready to begin yer journey as a Linux pirate! Ye can start by reading the rest of this book, or ye can try some of the challenges below.

#### **Question 1: Arrrrrgh**

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure firewall on the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Create a new firewall rule that allows incoming traffic on port `80` (HTTP) and port `443` (HTTPS) from the IP address of your pirate ship, and blocks all other incoming traffic.

2. Set up a new user account for the merchant vessel's captain with the username `captain` and the password `treasure`. The captain should have sudo privileges.

3. Set up a cron job that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager. If updates are available, the cron job should automatically install them.

**Answer:**

To create a new firewall rule that allows incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` from the IP address of your pirate ship and blocks all other incoming traffic, you can use the `ufw` utility. First, run the following command to enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Then, run the following command to allow incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` from your pirate ship's IP address:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <pirate ship IP address> to any port 80,443
```

Finally, run the following command to block all other incoming traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

To set up a new user account for the merchant vessel's captain with the username `captain` and the password `treasure`, and grant them sudo privileges, you can use the useradd and usermod commands. First, run the following command to create the new user account:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash captain
```

This will create a new user account with the username `captain` and a home directory at `/home/captain`. Next, run the following command to set the password for the `captain` user:

```bash
sudo passwd captain
```

Enter `treasure` as the password when prompted. Finally, run the following command to grant the `captain` user sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo captain
```

To set up a cron job that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 * * * * apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

This will run the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade -y` commands every hour. The `apt-get update` command checks for updates to the package manager, and the `apt-get upgrade -y` command installs any available updates.

#### **Question 2: The Black Pearl**

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure backup system for the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the rsync utility on the merchant vessel's servers.
2. Set up a script that runs daily and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers. The script should exclude certain directories (e.g. `/tmp`, `/var/log`) and compress the backup using `gzip`.
3. Set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups. The remote server should use SSH for secure communication.
4. Modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the rsync utility on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install rsync by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rsync -y
```

Once rsync is installed, you can configure it by editing the `/etc/rsync.conf` file. You can use a text editor like `nano` to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsync.conf
```

To set up a script that runs daily and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 0 * * * tar -czf /path/to/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/var/log /
```

This will run the tar command every day at midnight, creating a compressed archive of the entire file system (`/`) and excluding the `/tmp` and `/var/log` directories.

To set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups, you can use a variety of tools and techniques. One option is to install and configure a server application like openssh-server. On your pirate ship, run the following command to install openssh-server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y
```

Then, configure the server by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make any necessary changes to the configuration file (e.g. changing the default port number, enabling key-based authentication), then restart the server by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

To modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH, you can use the rsync command. First, create a new directory on the remote server to store the backups:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/backup
```

Then, run the following command to transfer the backups to the remote server:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/backup.tar.gz <remote server IP address>:/path/to/backup
```

#### **Question 3: The Flying Dutchman**

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure web server for the merchant vessel's website.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the Apache web server on the merchant vessel's servers. The web server should use the default port number and serve the website from the `/var/www/html` directory.
2. Set up a script that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager. If any updates are available, the script should install them.
3. Set up a cron job that runs every day at midnight and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers. The script should exclude certain directories (e.g. `/tmp`, `/var/log`) and compress the backup using `gzip`.
4. Set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups. The remote server should use SSH for secure communication.
5. Modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the Apache web server on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install Apache by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
```

Once Apache is installed, you can configure it by editing the `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file. You can use a text editor like `nano` to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

To set up a script that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 * * * * apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

This will run the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade -y` commands every hour. The `apt-get update` command checks for updates to the package manager, and the `apt-get upgrade -y` command installs any available updates.

To set up a cron job that runs every day at midnight and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 0 * * * tar -czf /path/to/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/var/log /
```

This will run the tar command every day at midnight, creating a compressed archive of the entire file system (`/`) and excluding the `/tmp` and `/var/log` directories.

To set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups, you can use a variety of tools and techniques. One option is to install and configure a server application like openssh-server. On your pirate ship, run the following command to install openssh-server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y
```

Then, configure the server by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make any necessary changes to the configuration file (e.g. changing the default port number, enabling key-based authentication), then restart the server by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

To modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH, you can use the rsync command. First, create a new directory on the remote server to store the backups:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/backup
```

Then, run the following command to transfer the backups to the remote server:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/backup.tar.gz <remote server IP address>:/path/to/backup
```

#### **Question 4: Operation Blackbeard**

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a version control system for the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the git version control system on the merchant vessel's servers.
2. Initialize a new git repository in the `/var/www/html` directory.
3. Add all of the files in the `/var/www/html` directory to the repository and commit the changes with the message `"Initial commit"`.
4. Set up a remote repository on your pirate ship using a service like GitHub or GitLab.
5. Connect the local repository on the merchant vessel's servers to the remote repository on your pirate ship.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the git version control system on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install `git` by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

Once git is installed, you can configure it by running the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your@email.com"` with your own name and email address.

To initialize a new git repository in the `/var/www/html` directory, navigate to that directory and run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This will create a new git repository in the current directory.

To add all of the files in the `/var/www/html` directory to the repository and commit the changes with the message `"Initial commit"`, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

The `git add` command stages all of the files in the current directory for commit, and the `git commit` command commits the changes with the specified message.

To set up a remote repository on your pirate ship using a service like GitHub or GitLab, you will need to create an account on the service and create a new repository. Follow the service's instructions for creating a new repository.

To connect the local repository on the merchant vessel's servers to the remote repository on your pirate ship, you will need to add the remote repository as a remote for your local repository. First, copy the URL of the remote repository from the service's website. Then, run the following command in your local repository:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
```

Replace `<remote repository URL>` with the actual URL of the remote repository. This will add the remote repository as a remote named `"origin"` for your local repository. To push your local commits to the remote repository, run the following command:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This will push the local master branch to the remote repository.

### **Is it YAML or YML?**

Both `.yml` and `.yaml` are file extensions for files written in the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files, but it can also be used to store and transmit data in a variety of applications.

The `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions are interchangeable, so you can use either one. Some people prefer to use `.yaml` because the .yml extension is often used for YAML configuration files in the Ruby on Rails framework, and the `.yaml` extension helps to indicate that the file is a YAML file, rather than a Ruby file. However, either extension will work for a YAML file.

## **GitHub Actions in the wild**

GitHub Actions runners come with a variety of tools and languages pre-installed, including Ruby. You can use Ruby to run scripts and build or test your code as part of your workflow.

To use Ruby in a workflow, you will need to specify an environment that has Ruby installed. You can do this using the runs-on property in your workflow file.

Here is an example of a job that runs on an Ubuntu runner and uses Ruby:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Ruby script
        run: ruby app.rb
```

In this example, the build job runs on an Ubuntu runner, which has Ruby pre-installed. You can then use the run action to execute a Ruby script by calling the ruby command followed by the name of the script.

> **Note** that you can also specify a different environment that has Ruby installed, such as a Windows or macOS runner.

## **Chapter Four - Desktop Environments and Window Managers**

Avast ye, mateys! In this chapter, we'll be setting sail with desktop environments and window managers in Ubuntu. These be the tools that be responsible for how ye interact with yer operating system and its applications. Let's set the course and dive in!

### **Desktop Environments**

A desktop environment be a collection o' software that be responsible for the overall look and feel o' yer operating system. It includes things like the desktop background, the panel at the top o' the screen, and the menus and icons that be used to launch applications.

Ubuntu comes with several desktop environments to choose from, including GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE. Each desktop environment be unique, with its own style and features. Let's take a closer look at each one:

#### **GNOME**

[Awesome GNOME](https://github.com/Kazhnuz/awesome-gnome)

GNOME be the default desktop environment for Ubuntu. It be a user-friendly and modern desktop environment that be designed to be easy to use and customize. It be also designed to be highly accessible, with features like a high contrast theme and text-to-speech support.

#### **KDE**

[Awesome KDE](https://github.com/francoism90/awesome-kde)

KDE be a desktop environment that be known for its high level o' customization and eye-catching visual effects. It be also highly configurable, with a wide range o' settings and options for tweaking the look and feel o' the desktop.

#### **Xfce**

[Xfce](https://www.xfce.org)

Xfce be a lightweight and fast desktop environment that be designed to be easy on resources. It be a good choice for pirates who be runnin' older or low-powered computers, or for those who be lookin' for a more minimalistic desktop experience.

#### **LXDE**

[LXDE](https://lxde.org)

LXDE be another lightweight and fast desktop environment, similar to Xfce. It be known for its low resource usage and simple, clean interface.

### **Window Managers**

A window manager be a software program that be responsible for the layout and appearance o' the windows on yer desktop. It be responsible for things like how windows be resized, moved, and minimized, as well as how the desktop be organized and navigated.

Ubuntu comes with several window managers to choose from, including Openbox, Fluxbox, and i3. Let's take a closer look at each one:

"Ahoy, mateys! Ye be warned, the circadas be a-singin' their song o' prime numbers. Ye can hear them all through the night, marking their time with the beat of their wings. But beware, for those numbers be the key to unlockin' treasure beyond yer wildest dreams. So set sail and follow the siren call o' the circadas, and ye may just find yerself a rich pirate indeed.

Are ye ready for a riddle that'll make ye scratch yer head and laugh yer head off?

**Here goes:**

"I be a five-digit number, ye see, With a 6 in the middle, as plain as can be. But when ye multiply me, ye best be aware, For I be the product of length times width, I swear.

So if ye be wantin' to know my true form, Ye'll need to figure out my length and my width, I warn. But take heart, me hearty, for I'll give ye a clue, I be a multiple of 6, that much is true.

So put on yer thinkin' cap and give it a try, And maybe, just maybe, ye'll figure out why I be the answer to this little game, And the product of length times width, all the same.

And remember, to fully solve this riddle and claim yer treasure, ye'll need to think outside the box and find the hidden key. It's not as obvious as it seems."

### Check Yer Deployments

A group of pirates were setting sail on a new adventure, but they quickly ran into trouble. The ship's DevOps pirate had accidentally deployed the anchor instead of the sails, and they were stuck in the harbor.

The captain, a seasoned veteran of the high seas, knew they needed to act fast. "We need to redeploy the sails and set sail immediately," he yelled. "But how are we going to do that with the anchor deployed?" asked the devops pirate, frantically trying to fix the mistake.

"Leave that to me," replied the captain, pulling out his trusty sword. "I'll just cut the anchor's deployment pipeline and redeploy the sails manually." And with a mighty swing, he severed the anchor's deployment pipeline and the ship was finally on its way.

From then on, the DevOps pirate made sure to double check his deployments before setting sail. And the rest of the crew lived happily ever after, sailing the seas and deploying their sails with ease.

## **Testemonials**

**Linus Torvalds:** "As the creator of the Linux kernel, I can confidently say that pirating software is a big no-no. But if I were a pirate, I'd have to say that Dean Lofts' book "Linux for Pirates" would be my go-to guide for all things pirate- and Linux-related. Dean may not be as seasoned a pirate as Captain Jack Sparrow, but he sure knows his stuff when it comes to Linux. And let's be honest, a little bit of clever hacking never hurt anyone in a fight against the Royal Navy."

**Richard Stallman:** "As a strong advocate for free software, I can't condone piracy in any form. However, if I had to choose a resource for learning about Linux and pirating, it would have to be Dean Lofts' book "Linux for Pirates!". Dean may not be as ruthless a pirate as Captain Jack Sparrow, but he's certainly got a way with words and a wicked sense of humor. Plus, his book is chock full of useful information for pirates looking to make the most of their Linux systems."

**Captain Jack Sparrow:** "Ahoy there, mateys! As a seasoned pirate, I can tell ye that there's no one I'd rather have by my side in a fight than Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman. And when it comes to learning about Linux and pirating, Dean Lofts' book "Linux for Pirates!" is a must-read. Dean may not have as much experience on the high seas as I do, but he sure knows his way around a Linux system. So hoist the sails and let's set a course for adventure, with Dean's book as our guide!"
