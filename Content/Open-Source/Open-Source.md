# Open Source

## **What is open source software?**

Open source software is software that is freely available to anyone who wants to use it, modify it, or distribute it. It is a model for software development that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code.

Open source software is often developed using a model called "open source development", which is a process that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code. In this model, the source code for the software is made available to the community, and anyone can contribute to the project by writing code, fixing bugs, or improving the software in some way.

### **What are open source licenses?**

Open source licenses are legal documents that grant users the right to use, modify, and distribute open source software. They are used to protect the rights of the developers and users of open source software, and to ensure that the software remains free and open.

There are many different open source licenses, and each one has its own set of rules and requirements. The most popular open source licenses are the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the MIT License.

### **What is the GNU General Public License (GPL)?**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free and open-source software license that is used by many open source projects. It is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works can only be distributed under the same license terms.

The GPL was originally developed by Richard Stallman in 1989, and was released as open source software under the GNU General Public License. It is one of the most widely used open source licenses, and is used by many popular open source projects, including the Linux kernel, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and the GNU C Library (glibc).

### **What is the MIT License?**

The MIT License is a free and open-source software license that is used by many open source projects. It is a permissive license, which means that derivative works can be distributed under any license.

The MIT License was originally developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980, and was released as open source software under the MIT License. It is one of the most widely used open source licenses, and is used by many popular open source projects, including the Node.js runtime, the jQuery JavaScript library, and the Angular web framework.
