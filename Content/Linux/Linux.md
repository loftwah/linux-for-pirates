# **Linux**

## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### **What is GNU?**

GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Richard Stallman in 1983. At the time, Stallman was a computer science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Stallman began working on GNU as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system in 1983. He made the source code for GNU available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

## **Linux filesystem**

Ahoy matey! Welcome to the world of Linux filesystems, where we navigate through the vast ocean of data like pirates searching for buried treasure.

In the Linux filesystem, everything is organized into a single tree structure, starting at the root directory represented by a forward slash (/). This root directory contains all the other directories and files on the system, and can be thought of as the base of the tree.

Within the root directory, there are several subdirectories that serve important functions. For example, the "home" directory (/home) is where each user on the system has their own personal space to store their files and documents. The "etc" directory (/etc) contains configuration files for the system, while the "bin" directory (/bin) stores executable programs that are used by the system and its users.

Just like on a pirate ship, each member of the crew has their own designated areas to store their belongings. Similarly, in the Linux filesystem, each user has their own home directory where they can store their files and personalize their environment.

But be warned, matey! Just like how a pirate's treasure is guarded by treacherous traps and obstacles, the Linux filesystem also has its own set of permissions and ownership rules. Only certain users are allowed access to certain files and directories, and it's up to the system administrator (the captain of the ship) to set these permissions and make sure everything is running smoothly.

So set sail and explore the seas of data, but always remember to respect the rules of the Linux filesystem and the hierarchies of ownership and access. Arrr!

### **Filesystem examples**

Aye aye, matey! Here are some examples of common tasks that a pirate (or a Linux user) might encounter when using the Linux filesystem:

**Navigating the filesystem:** Just like how a pirate navigates the open seas, a Linux user can navigate the filesystem using the `cd` command to change directories and the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory. For example, to navigate to the root directory, a pirate might type `cd /`, and to see a list of the files and directories within the current directory, they might type `ls`.

**Creating and deleting files and directories:** A pirate might need to create a new file or directory to store their loot or maps. To do this, they can use the `touch` command to create a new file or the `mkdir` command to create a new directory. For example, to create a new file called `treasure_map.txt` within the current directory, a pirate might type `touch treasure_map.txt`. To delete a file or directory, they can use the `rm` command. For example, to delete the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `rm treasure_map.txt`.

**Copying and moving files and directories:** A pirate might need to copy or move a file or directory from one location to another, just like how they might need to move their treasure chest from one part of the ship to another. To copy a file or directory, a pirate can use the `cp` command, and to move a file or directory, they can use the `mv` command. For example, to copy the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `cp treasure_map.txt /home`. To move the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `mv treasure_map.txt /home`.

**Viewing and editing files:** A pirate might need to view the contents of a file or edit it to update their treasure map. To view the contents of a file, a pirate can use the `cat` command, and to edit a file, they can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. For example, to view the contents of the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `cat treasure_map.txt`, and to edit the file `treasure_map.txt` using the `nano` text editor, they might type `nano treasure_map.txt`.

I hope these examples give you a better understanding of how the Linux filesystem works and how a pirate might use it to complete common tasks. Arrr!

### **Permissions**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, file permissions are like the rules and regulations that govern access to a pirate's treasure. Just like how a pirate might only allow certain members of their crew to access their treasure, in Linux, file permissions control who is allowed to read, write, and execute specific files and directories.

Each file and directory in the Linux filesystem has an owner and a group associated with it. The owner is the user who created the file or directory, and the group is a collection of users that the owner can assign permissions to. File permissions can be set for the owner, the group, and everyone else (referred to as "others").

There are three types of permissions that can be set for each file or directory: read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`). The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. The write permission allows a user to modify or delete a file or add or remove files from a directory. The execute permission allows a user to execute a file as a program or to enter a directory and access its contents.

File permissions can be displayed using the `ls -l` command, which shows a list of files and directories along with their permissions. For example, the output might look something like this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 pirate pirate 4096 Jan 1 00:00 treasure_chest
```

The first character (d) indicates that this is a directory. The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the permissions for the owner, the next three (r-x) represent the permissions for the group, and the final three (`r-x`) represent the permissions for others.

To change the permissions of a file or directory, a pirate can use the `chmod` command. For example, to give the owner and the group read and write permissions for the file `treasure_map.txt`, but only read permission for others, a pirate might type `chmod 640 treasure_map.txt`.

I hope this helps you understand how file permissions work in Linux and how a pirate might use them to control access to their treasures. Arrr!

#### **chmod**

Ahoy matey! The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. Ye can use it to give or remove read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, the group, and others.

```bash
# Add execute for all (treasurehunter.sh)
chmod a+x treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute, group/global to read only (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod u=rwx, go=r treasurehunter.sh
# Remove write from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod a-w treasurehunter.sh
# Remove read/write/execute from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod = treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write and group/global read (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 644 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute and group/global read/execute (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 755 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user/group/global to read/write (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 666 treasurehunter.sh
```

#### **chown**

Ahoy matey! The `chown` command is used to change the owner and group of a file or directory. Ye can use it to change the owner and group of a file or directory to a specific user or group.

```bash
# Change owner to pirate (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate and group to pirates (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate:pirates treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate recursively (treasure_chest)
chown -R pirate treasure_chest
# Change owner to pirate and group to pirates recursively (treasure_chest)
chown -R pirate:pirates treasure_chest
```
