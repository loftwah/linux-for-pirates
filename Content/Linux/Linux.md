# **Linux**

## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### **What is GNU?**

GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Richard Stallman in 1983. At the time, Stallman was a computer science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Stallman began working on GNU as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system in 1983. He made the source code for GNU available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

## **Linux filesystem**

Ahoy matey! Welcome to the world of Linux filesystems, where we navigate through the vast ocean of data like pirates searching for buried treasure.

In the Linux filesystem, everything is organized into a single tree structure, starting at the root directory represented by a forward slash (/). This root directory contains all the other directories and files on the system, and can be thought of as the base of the tree.

Within the root directory, there are several subdirectories that serve important functions. For example, the "home" directory (/home) is where each user on the system has their own personal space to store their files and documents. The "etc" directory (/etc) contains configuration files for the system, while the "bin" directory (/bin) stores executable programs that are used by the system and its users.

Just like on a pirate ship, each member of the crew has their own designated areas to store their belongings. Similarly, in the Linux filesystem, each user has their own home directory where they can store their files and personalize their environment.

But be warned, matey! Just like how a pirate's treasure is guarded by treacherous traps and obstacles, the Linux filesystem also has its own set of permissions and ownership rules. Only certain users are allowed access to certain files and directories, and it's up to the system administrator (the captain of the ship) to set these permissions and make sure everything is running smoothly.

So set sail and explore the seas of data, but always remember to respect the rules of the Linux filesystem and the hierarchies of ownership and access. Arrr!

### **Filesystem examples**

Aye aye, matey! Here are some examples of common tasks that a pirate (or a Linux user) might encounter when using the Linux filesystem:

**Navigating the filesystem:** Just like how a pirate navigates the open seas, a Linux user can navigate the filesystem using the `cd` command to change directories and the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory. For example, to navigate to the root directory, a pirate might type `cd /`, and to see a list of the files and directories within the current directory, they might type `ls`.

**Creating and deleting files and directories:** A pirate might need to create a new file or directory to store their loot or maps. To do this, they can use the `touch` command to create a new file or the `mkdir` command to create a new directory. For example, to create a new file called `treasure_map.txt` within the current directory, a pirate might type `touch treasure_map.txt`. To delete a file or directory, they can use the `rm` command. For example, to delete the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `rm treasure_map.txt`.

**Copying and moving files and directories:** A pirate might need to copy or move a file or directory from one location to another, just like how they might need to move their treasure chest from one part of the ship to another. To copy a file or directory, a pirate can use the `cp` command, and to move a file or directory, they can use the `mv` command. For example, to copy the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `cp treasure_map.txt /home`. To move the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `mv treasure_map.txt /home`.

**Viewing and editing files:** A pirate might need to view the contents of a file or edit it to update their treasure map. To view the contents of a file, a pirate can use the `cat` command, and to edit a file, they can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. For example, to view the contents of the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `cat treasure_map.txt`, and to edit the file `treasure_map.txt` using the `nano` text editor, they might type `nano treasure_map.txt`.

I hope these examples give you a better understanding of how the Linux filesystem works and how a pirate might use it to complete common tasks. Arrr!

### **Permissions**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, file permissions are like the rules and regulations that govern access to a pirate's treasure. Just like how a pirate might only allow certain members of their crew to access their treasure, in Linux, file permissions control who is allowed to read, write, and execute specific files and directories.

Each file and directory in the Linux filesystem has an owner and a group associated with it. The owner is the user who created the file or directory, and the group is a collection of users that the owner can assign permissions to. File permissions can be set for the owner, the group, and everyone else (referred to as "others").

There are three types of permissions that can be set for each file or directory: read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`). The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. The write permission allows a user to modify or delete a file or add or remove files from a directory. The execute permission allows a user to execute a file as a program or to enter a directory and access its contents.

File permissions can be displayed using the `ls -l` command, which shows a list of files and directories along with their permissions. For example, the output might look something like this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 pirate pirate 4096 Jan 1 00:00 treasure_chest
```

The first character (d) indicates that this is a directory. The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the permissions for the owner, the next three (r-x) represent the permissions for the group, and the final three (`r-x`) represent the permissions for others.

To change the permissions of a file or directory, a pirate can use the `chmod` command. For example, to give the owner and the group read and write permissions for the file `treasure_map.txt`, but only read permission for others, a pirate might type `chmod 640 treasure_map.txt`.

I hope this helps you understand how file permissions work in Linux and how a pirate might use them to control access to their treasures. Arrr!

#### **chmod**

Ahoy matey! The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. Ye can use it to give or remove read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, the group, and others.

```bash
# Add execute for all (treasurehunter.sh)
chmod a+x treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute, group/global to read only (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod u=rwx, go=r treasurehunter.sh
# Remove write from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod a-w treasurehunter.sh
# Remove read/write/execute from user/group/global (treasurehunter.sh), symbolic mode
chmod = treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write and group/global read (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 644 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user to read/write/execute and group/global read/execute (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 755 treasurehunter.sh
# Set user/group/global to read/write (treasurehunter.sh), octal notation
chmod 666 treasurehunter.sh
```

#### **chown**

Ahoy matey! The `chown` command is used to change the owner and group of a file or directory. Ye can use it to change the owner and group of a file or directory to a specific user or group.

```bash
# Change owner to pirate (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate and group to pirates (treasure_map.txt)
chown pirate:pirates treasure_map.txt
# Change owner to pirate recursively (treasure_chest)
chown -R pirate treasure_chest
# Change owner to pirate and group to pirates recursively (treasure_chest)
chown -R pirate:pirates treasure_chest

### **Handybilly**

A handybilly is a notebook that a pirate should carry with them at all times. It be used to keep track of important information, such as passwords, notes, and other useful tidbits. Ye can use yer handybilly to keep track of the information that ye learn in this book.

`ls`: This command be used to list the files and directories in a directory. Ye can use it to see what be in yer current directory or specify a different directory to list.

`cd`: This command be used to change the current directory ye be working in. Ye can use it to navigate to different directories on yer system.

`pwd`: This command be used to print the current working directory. Ye can use it to see where ye be in the file system.

`mkdir`: This command be used to create a new directory. Ye can use it to create directories to organize yer files.

`touch`: This command be used to create a new file. Ye can use it to create empty files or update the timestamp on an existing file.

`cp`: This command be used to copy files and directories. Ye can use it to make copies of yer files or move them to different locations on yer system.

`mv`: This command be used to move or rename files and directories. Ye can use it to rearrange yer files or change their names.

`rm`: This command be used to delete files and directories. Ye can use it to remove unwanted files from yer system.

#### **Bash**

Ahoy matey! Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Just like how a pirate might use a compass to navigate through the open seas, Bash helps users navigate and interact with their operating system by allowing them to enter commands and execute programs.

Bash is a powerful tool that allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks, including running programs, creating and editing files and directories, and managing system processes. It also provides features like command history, tab completion, and shell scripting, which allow users to automate tasks and customize their environment.

To use Bash, a pirate would open a terminal window and type commands at the prompt. The prompt is a symbol that indicates that Bash is ready to accept commands, and it usually looks something like this:

```bash
pirate@cove:~$
```

The prompt includes the username (pirate), the hostname (cove), and the current working directory (indicated by the tilde character).

Bash supports a wide variety of commands, including built-in commands like `ls` (list the contents of a directory) and `cd` (change the current working directory), as well as external programs like `grep` (search for patterns in text) and `awk` (process text).

I hope this helps you understand what Bash is and how a pirate might use it to interact with their operating system. Arrr!

##### **.bashrc**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.bashrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user logs in to their system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.bashrc` file can be used to customize a user's environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.bashrc` file might look something like this:

```bash
# Set the prompt to include the current time
PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h \[\e[33m\]\w\[\e[35m\] \t\[\e[m\]\$ "

# Set the default editor to Vim
export EDITOR=vim

# Set an alias for the ls command
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

The first line sets the prompt to include the current time. The second line sets the default editor to Vim. The third line sets an alias for the `ls` command, which is a shortcut that can be used to run the command. For example, a pirate could type `ls` instead of `ls --color=auto`.

##### **Bash scripting**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, Bash scripting is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to automate tasks and customize their environment. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash scripts can be used to automate common tasks and make it easier for users to perform repetitive operations.

A Bash script is a plain text file that contains a series of commands that are executed in order. For example, a pirate might create a script that backs up their important documents to a USB drive. The script might look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Backup important documents to a USB drive
cp -r /home/pirate/Documents /media/usb
```

The first line of the script is called the shebang, and it tells the system which program should be used to execute the script. In this case, the shebang tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script.

The second line is a comment, which is a line that is ignored by the system. Comments are useful for providing information about the script, such as what it does and how it should be used.

The third line is the actual command that is executed by the script. In this case, the command copies the `Documents` directory from the user's home directory to the USB drive.

I hope this helps you understand what Bash scripting is and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks and customize their environment. Arrr!

##### **Bash history**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the Bash history can be used to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session.

The Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `cd` command to change the current directory, the `ls` command will be added to the Bash history.

The Bash history can be viewed by using the `history` command. The `history` command will display a list of commands that have been executed in the current session, along with the line number of each command. The line number can be used to re-execute a command.

I hope this helps you understand what the Bash history is and how a pirate might use it to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Arrr!

##### **Bash one-liners**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash one-liners can be used to perform a single task.

A Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `grep` command to search for a specific file, the `ls | grep` command will be a Bash one-liner.

Bash one-liners can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, including searching for files, counting lines, and sorting text. The `man` command can be used to view the manual page for a command, which will provide information about how the command can be used.

I hope this helps you understand what a Bash one-liner is and how a pirate might use it to perform a single task. Arrr!

- "I be needin' to list all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`ls`

- "I be needin' to see the contents of this file, arrr!"

`cat [filename]`

- "I be needin' to search for a specific string in all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`grep "[search string]" *`

- "I be needin' to see all the processes runnin' on this machine, arrr!"

`ps aux`

- "I be needin' to see the available disk space on this machine, arrr!"

`df -h`

- "I be needin' to see the network connections on this machine, arrr!"

`netstat -tulpn`

- "I be needin' to see the system logs, arrr!"

`tail -f /var/log/syslog`

### **chroot**

Ahoy matey! The `chroot` command is used to change the root directory for the current shell session. Ye can use it to run a command or shell with a different root directory.

```bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (bash)
chroot /tmp bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (sh)
chroot /tmp sh
# Change root directory to /tmp (zsh)
chroot /tmp zsh
# Change root directory to /tmp (fish)
chroot /tmp fish
```

### **Cron**

[Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, cron is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to schedule tasks to be automatically executed at a specific time or interval. This can be useful for tasks that need to be run regularly, such as backing up important documents or cleaning up temporary files.

Cron uses a configuration file called the `crontab` to specify the tasks that it should execute. Each line in the crontab file represents a single task, and consists of six fields separated by spaces:

Minute (0-59)
Hour (0-23)
Day of the month (1-31)
Month of the year (1-12)
Day of the week (0-6, with 0 representing Sunday)
Command to execute
For example, to schedule a task to be executed every day at midnight, a pirate might add the following line to their crontab file:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/task
```

To edit the crontab file, a pirate can use the `crontab -e` command. This will open the file in a text editor, where they can add, modify, or delete tasks as needed.

It's important to note that cron tasks are executed with the permissions of the user who owns the crontab file, so it's important to make sure that the tasks have the necessary permissions to run correctly.

I hope this helps you understand how cron works and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks on their Linux system. Arrr!

### **Devices**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a device is a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, devices can be used to interact with the operating system.

A device can be thought of as a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system.

The `lsblk` command can be used to view a list of all the devices that are currently connected to the system. The `lsblk` command will display a list of devices, along with information about each device, such as the device name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a device is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Drivers**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a driver is a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, drivers can be used to interact with the operating system.

A driver can be thought of as a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system. The driver for the USB drive allows the device to interact with the operating system.

The `lsmod` command can be used to view a list of all the drivers that are currently loaded on the system. The `lsmod` command will display a list of drivers, along with information about each driver, such as the driver name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a driver is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Processes**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a process is a program that is currently running on the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, processes can be used to perform tasks and interact with the operating system.

A process can be thought of as an instance of a program. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

A process can be thought of as a program that is currently running on the system. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

An example of how to kill a process using the `kill` command:

```bash
kill 1234
```

To find the process ID of a process, a pirate can use the `ps` command. The `ps` command will display a list of processes, along with information about each process, such as the process ID, name, and status.

I hope this helps you understand what a process is and how a pirate might use it to perform tasks and interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **curl**

curl be a command line tool for transferring data using various network protocols. It be a powerful tool that be widely used by systems administrators and developers for a variety of tasks, such as testing APIs, downloading files, and more. Here be some basics ye should know to use cURL:

**Syntax:** The basic syntax for using cURL be `curl [options] [URL]`. Ye can specify various options to control how cURL be behavior, and then specify the URL of the resource ye be requesting.

**Protocols:** cURL support a wide range of network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more. Ye can specify the protocol ye be using by including it in the URL, or ye can use the -P option to specify the protocol.

**HTTP methods:** cURL support all of the HTTP methods, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. Ye can use the `-X` option to specify the method ye be using.

Request headers: cURL allow ye to specify custom request headers to be sent with yer request. Ye can use the `-H` option to specify a header, such as `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` to specify the content type of yer request.

Request data: cURL allow ye to specify data to be sent with yer request, such as form data or a `JSON` payload. Ye can use the -d option to specify the data ye be sending.

> **Note** If ye be sending JSON data, ye should use the `--data-raw` option instead of the `-d` option. The `-d` option will escape the JSON payload, which will cause the request to fail.

Response headers: cURL allow ye to view the response headers that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-i` option to view the response headers.

Response body: cURL allow ye to view the response body that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-o` option to save the response body to a file, or ye can use the `-O` option to save the response body to a file with the same name as the file on the server.

I hope this helps you understand how cURL works and how a pirate might use it to make HTTP requests. Arrr!

> **Note** if ye ever get stuck use `curl cht.sh/:help` to get help

A typical cURL `GET` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

A typical cURL `POST` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

### **Zsh**

Arrr matey! Zsh, also known as the "Z shell," is a Unix shell and command-line interpreter that you can use on your Linux system. It's similar to other shells like the Bourne shell (sh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash), but it offers additional features and functionality that can make it easier and more efficient to use.

To get started with zsh on your Linux system, you'll need to install it first. You can do this using your system's package manager, such as "apt" on Debian-based systems or "yum" on Red Hat-based systems. For example, you might run a command like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zsh -y
```

Once zsh is installed, you can start using it by launching a terminal window and entering `zsh` at the command prompt. This will launch the zsh shell, and you can start entering commands just like you would with any other shell.

You can also set zsh as your default shell, so that it will be launched automatically whenever you open a terminal window. To do this, you'll need to use the `chsh` command and specify the path to the zsh executable. For example:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

I hope this helps get you started with zsh on your Linux system, matey! Let me know if you have any other questions.

#### **Oh My Zsh**

Oh My Zsh is a popular open-source project that helps users configure and customize the Z shell (zsh). It provides a variety of themes, plugins, and features that can make it easier to use zsh and add additional functionality to your terminal.

To use Oh My Zsh, you'll need to install it on your system. You can do this by following the instructions:

- Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- Follow the prompts to install Oh My Zsh.
- Once the installation is complete, you can start using Oh My Zsh by launching a terminal window and entering `zsh` at the command prompt.

Once you have Oh My Zsh installed, you can start using it by launching a terminal window and entering "zsh" at the command prompt. This will launch the zsh shell with Oh My Zsh configured, and you'll see a variety of additional features and options available to you.

You can customize Oh My Zsh by modifying the configuration file located at "~/.zshrc" and selecting different themes or plugins to use. There are many themes and plugins available, so you can choose the ones that best suit your needs and preferences.

### **Vim (Vi IMproved)**

Vim be a text editor that be widely used by developers and systems administrators for editing files in the command line. It be a powerful tool that be highly customizable, and it be known for its steep learning curve. Here be some things ye should know to use Vim effectively:

Modes: Vim be operated in different modes, including normal mode, insert mode, and command mode. Ye'll need to understand these modes and how to switch between them in order to effectively use Vim.

Movement: In normal mode, ye can use movement commands to navigate around yer document. These include commands like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move left, down, up, and right, respectively.

Editing: In insert mode, ye can enter text and make changes to yer document. To enter insert mode, ye can use the `i` command.

Saving and quitting: To save yer changes and quit Vim, ye can use the :wq command in command mode. To save yer changes and continue editing, ye can use the :w command. To quit without saving, ye can use the `:q!` command.

Customization: Vim be highly customizable, and ye can configure it to suit yer needs and preferences. Ye can customize Vim by editing the .vimrc configuration file or by using Lua to create custom plugins.

#### **.vimrc**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.vimrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user starts Vim. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.vimrc` file can be used to customize a user's Vim environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.vimrc` file might look like this:

```vim
" Set the color scheme to material
colorscheme material
" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on
" Enable line numbers
set number
" Enable relative line numbers
set relativenumber
" Enable auto-indenting
set autoindent
" Enable smart indenting
set smartindent
" Enable line wrapping
set wrap
" Enable spell checking
