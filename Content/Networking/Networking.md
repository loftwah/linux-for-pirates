## **DNS (Domain Name System)**

In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that maps human-readable domain names (such as "example.com") to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS helps to make it easier for people to access websites and other online resources, as it allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of having to remember complex numerical addresses.

In a pirate theme, you could think of DNS as a way to navigate the vast and often-treacherous seas of the internet. Just as a map helps a pirate to find their way from one island to another, DNS helps to guide internet users to the websites and online resources they are looking for. Instead of having to remember the exact location of each island (website), a pirate can simply consult their map (DNS) to find the right route.

DNS also helps to ensure that internet users can reach their destination even if the underlying landscape (IP addresses) changes. Just as a pirate might need to adjust their course if the winds or currents shift, DNS can automatically route internet users to the correct location even if the underlying IP addresses change. This helps to make the internet more reliable and accessible, even in the midst of constantly-changing conditions.

### **Types of DNS Records**

There are several different types of DNS records that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. The most common types of DNS records are A records, which map a domain name to a single IP address, and CNAME records, which map a domain name to another domain name. Other types of DNS records include MX records, which map a domain name to an email server, and TXT records, which can be used to store arbitrary text data.

### **Examples of DNS Records**

**A record:**

`pirate.com.      IN A      127.0.0.1`

This A record maps the domain name "pirate.com" to the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

**CNAME record:**

`pirateship.pirate.com.      IN CNAME      pirate.com.`

This CNAME record maps the domain name "pirateship.pirate.com" to the domain name "pirate.com".

**MX record:**

`pirate.com.      IN MX      10 mail.pirate.com.`

This MX record specifies that the mail server for the domain "pirate.com" is located at "mail.pirate.com". The number "10" is the preference value, which determines the priority of the mail server.

**NS record:**

`pirate.com.      IN NS      ns1.pirate.com.
pirate.com.      IN NS      ns2.pirate.com.`

These NS records specify the name servers for the domain "pirate.com".

### **DNS servers**

Ahoy there! DNS servers be the computers that store the DNS records for a given domain. When a user tries to access a website, their computer will first query a DNS server to find the IP address for the requested domain. The DNS server will then return the IP address to the user's computer, which can then use the IP address to connect to the requested website.

**DNSSEC**

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) be a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that help to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and authentic. It does this by adding digital signatures to DNS records, which can be used to verify that the DNS records have not been tampered with. It also adds a mechanism for verifying that the DNS server that is responding to a query be the correct DNS server for the requested domain.

**DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over HTTPS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over TLS (DoT)**

DNS over TLS (DoT) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over TLS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over QUIC (DoQ)**

DNS over QUIC (DoQ) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over QUIC instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNSCrypt**

DNSCrypt be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private. It does this by encrypting DNS queries and responses using the NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library) encryption library.

**DNS Amplification Attacks**

DNS amplification attacks be a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic. They work by sending a large number of DNS queries to a DNS server, which will then respond to each query with a large amount of data. This can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic, which can cause the server to become overloaded and crash.

**Hosts file**

The hosts file be a file that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. It be typically located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux systems, but the exact location may vary depending on the operating system. The hosts file can be used to override the DNS records for a given domain, which can be useful for testing purposes.

**AWS Route 53**

## **Networking**

[PacketLife](https://packetlife.net/)

Ahoy there me hearties! Welcome to the wonderful world of computer networking, where the bytes flow like rum and the packets be flyin' like cannonballs. Ye be a fresh recruit to the tech industry, and it be time for ye to learn the ropes of this digital high seas.

First things first, let's talk about the lingo of the land. Ye be hearin' words like "MAC addresses" and "frames" thrown around like a shanty at a crew singalong. A MAC address be a unique identifier for a device on a network, kind of like a pirate's tattoo. And frames, why they be like the hull of a ship, holdin' all the important information together as it travels across the network.

Next, we have packets, the little buccaneers of data, carryin' information from one port to another. And just like how a pirate ship needs a crew to navigate, packets be usin' protocols like TCP and IP to make sure they reach their destination safe and sound.

And what be a network without a map? Ye be needin' IP addresses to navigate these digital waters and find yer way to other ships. And just like how ye need a compass to find true north, ye be usin' DNS to find the IP address of a website.

Routing protocols be like the maps and compass of the network world, they help guide packets to their destination. Let's take a look at some of the most commonly used ones:

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** This be a link state routing protocol, it's used mostly in large enterprise networks and service providers. It builds a map of the entire network and uses the shortest path to route the packets.

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** This be a Cisco proprietary protocol, it's similar to OSPF but it's more efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and faster convergence. It's mostly used in Cisco networks.

**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** This be one of the oldest routing protocols, it's simple to configure and it's mostly used in small networks. It uses hop count as the metric for determining the best path for routing.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** This be the king of routing protocols, it's used to route packets between different autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. It's more complex to configure than the other protocols and it's mostly used by service providers and large organizations. It uses a path vector algorithm to determine the best path.

**IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** This be another link-state routing protocol, it's mainly used in large service provider networks and it's similar to OSPF.

So, as you may expect BGP be specially important for internet routing and used for interconnect different networks, it's a robust and complex protocol that requires a good understanding of how internet routing works.

So there ye have it, a quick overview of the most common routing protocols. Remember, just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator, a network needs a good routing protocol to reach its destination.

So grab yerself a mug of grog and set sail on this journey through the tech industry. And remember, always keep a lookout for them scallywag hackers tryin' to steal yer treasure.

Yarr!

`arp`: This command be used to display and manipulate the system's ARP cache. Ye can use it to view the ARP cache, add or delete entries, and more.

  Ahoy matey! An ARP request be like a call to the crew of another ship, askin' for their location on the network. Ye see, on a ship, ye need to know where everyone be to coordinate yer actions. Same goes for a network, each device needs to know the location of other devices to communicate with them.

  An ARP request be a broadcast message sent by a device, askin' other devices on the network "Where be the device with this IP address? Give me its MAC address so I can talk to it." And just like how a crew member would respond with their location, the other devices on the network respond with their MAC address.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good lookout to spot other ships, a network needs ARP to spot other devices and communicate with them.

  Yarr!

`ip`: This command be used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

`ping`: This command be used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. Ye can use it to check if yer system be able to reach another device on the network.

`traceroute`: This command be used to trace the route between yer system and another device on the network. Ye can use it to see the path that packets be taking between yer system and the destination.

`netstat`: This command be used to display information about yer system's network connections and routing tables. Ye can use it to view information about active connections and network routes.

  Ahoy matey! ICMP be like a messenger bird for yer network, it be used for sendin' error messages and status information between devices. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs to send messages to other ships to coordinate actions, a network needs to send messages to other devices to coordinate communication.

  ICMP be used for a variety of things, such as letting a device know that it can't reach a destination, or that a destination is too busy to respond. It also be used for diagnostic purposes, such as the "ping" command, which be like shoutin' "Ahoy!" to a ship to see if they be there.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good messenger to send important messages, a network needs ICMP to send important information between devices.

  SNMP be like the ship's log of yer network, it be used for keepin' track of all the happenings on the network and givin' ye information about the devices connected to it. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs a log to keep track of its journey, a network needs SNMP to keep track of what's happening on it.

  SNMP be used for monitorin' and managin' devices on a network, it be used to gather information about the devices, such as their uptime, CPU usage, and memory usage, and it can also be used to change settings on the devices.

  SNMP be based on a client-server model, the devices on the network be the "servers" and the network management system be the "client". The client sends SNMP requests to the servers and the servers respond with the requested information.

  SNMP is one of the most common protocol for network management, it's easy to use and widely supported by many different vendors. And just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator to find its way, a network needs SNMP to find its way around and keep track of everything.

  Yarr!

`route`: This command be used to view and modify the routing table on yer system. Ye can use it to add, delete, or modify routes on yer system.

#### **ip**

Ahoy matey! The `ip` command is used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

```

#### **Netcat**

Ahoy matey! Netcat, or `nc`, is a command-line utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, `nc` can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

```bash

#### **Wireshark**

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

Ahoy matey! Wireshark, or the network protocol analyzer, is a graphical utility for network traffic analysis. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, Wireshark can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

## **Subnet**

A subnet (short for "subnetwork") can be thought of as a smaller network that is contained within a larger network. It is a way to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable parts.

Imagine that a group of pirates have set up a network to communicate with each other over the internet. The network might be very large, with many different pirates and devices connected to it. To make it easier to manage and organize the network, the pirates might decide to create subnets.

For example, they might create a subnet for pirates who are located in the same geographical area, or they might create a subnet for pirates who are working on the same project. This would allow them to easily communicate with each other and share resources, while also keeping their communication separate from other parts of the network.

In a real-world context, subnets are often used to improve the efficiency of networks by reducing the amount of traffic that needs to be routed between different parts of the network. They can also be used to improve security by isolating different parts of the network from each other.

### **Subnet mask**

A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to determine which devices are part of the same subnet.

Imagine that a group of pirates are using subnets to divide their network into smaller, more manageable parts. Each pirate has an IP address that is assigned to their device, and the subnet mask is used to identify which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host.

For example, if the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", it means that the first three octets (groups of 8 bits) of the IP address represent the network portion, while the last octet represents the host portion. Using this information, the pirates can determine which devices are part of the same subnet and can communicate with each other directly, without having to go through a router.

In the real-world, subnet masks are used to divide networks into smaller, more manageable parts and to improve the efficiency of communication between devices on a network. They are an important part of the IP addressing system, and they are used in many different types of networks, including pirate networks.

### **How to calculate a subnet mask**

Determine the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create. Consider factors such as the number of pirates and devices that will be connected to the network, the geographical location of the pirates, and the types of resources that will be shared on the network.

Select a subnet mask that is appropriate for your network. A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. The subnet mask will depend on the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create.

Calculate the subnet address for each subnet. To do this, you will need to use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device on the network. The subnet address is the portion of the IP address that belongs to the network, as identified by the subnet mask.

Assign an IP address to each device on the network. The IP address should be unique for each device, and it should include the subnet address for the subnet that the device is part of.

For example, let's say that you have a network with 100 pirates, and you want to create 10 subnets with 10 pirates each. You might select a subnet mask of "255.255.255.0", which would allow you to create up to 256 subnets. To calculate the subnet address for each subnet, you would use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device. For example, if the IP address of a device is "192.168.1.1", and the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", the subnet address would be "192.168.1.0".

### **Subnetting Cheatsheet**

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, called subnets. Subnetting allows an organization to break up its network into smaller, more manageable pieces, and assign specific subnets to different departments or locations.

#### **Subnet Mask**

A subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number that is used to divide the IP address into the network portion and the host portion. The subnet mask is used to determine which portion of the IP address belongs to the network and which portion belongs to the host.

The subnet mask is usually written in the form of an IP address, such as `255.255.255.0`, but it is actually a binary number. To determine the subnet mask in binary, each octet (the numbers separated by periods) is converted to binary:

```bash
`255.255.255.0
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
```

The subnet mask is used in conjunction with the IP address to determine which portion of the IP address belongs to the network and which portion belongs to the host.

#### **CIDR Notation**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a standard syntax for representing IP addresses and their associated subnet masks. In CIDR notation, the subnet mask is represented by a slash followed by a number, called the prefix length.

For example, the subnet mask `255.255.255.0` can be written in CIDR notation as `/24`, because the first 24 bits are set to 1 and the remaining 8 bits are set to 0.

#### **Subnetting a Network**

To subnet a network, the network administrator must first determine the number of subnets needed and the number of hosts per subnet. The network administrator can then use the following formula to determine the subnet mask:

```bash
`2^n - 2 = total number of hosts per subnet`
```

Where `n` is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion of the IP address to create the subnets.

For example, if a network administrator needs to create 8 subnets, each with 30 hosts, the following steps can be taken:

1. Determine the number of bits needed to create 8 subnets: `log2 8 = 3`
2. Determine the number of bits needed to support 30 hosts per subnet: `log2 30 = 5`
3. Add the number of bits needed for the subnets and the number of bits needed for the hosts: `3 + 5 = 8`
4. Determine the subnet mask by setting the first `8` bits to 1 and the remaining bits to 0: `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`
5. Convert the subnet mask to CIDR notation: `/23`

#### **Subnetting Examples**

Here are some more examples of how to subnet a network using the subnet mask and CIDR notation:

- To create 16 subnets, each with 4 hosts:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000`
  - CIDR notation: `/28`
- To create 32 subnets, each with 2 hosts:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000`
  - CIDR notation: `/29`
- To create 64 subnets, each with 1 host:
  - Subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100`
  - CIDR notation: `/30`

#### **Subnetting Practice**

Here are some practice problems to help you get familiar with subnetting:

1. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`?
2. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000`?
3. How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you create with the following subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`?

**Answers:**

1. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`, you can create 4 subnets, each with 2048 hosts.
2. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000`, you can create 8 subnets, each with 1024 hosts.
3. With a subnet mask of `11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000`, you can create 16 subnets, each with 512 hosts.

## **HTTP**

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data on the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to transfer data from a server to a client, or vice versa.

In a pirate theme, you could think of HTTP as the system that allows pirates to send and receive messages and information as they sail the seas of the internet. Just like a pirate ship uses a flag to communicate with other ships, a website uses HTTP to communicate with a client's web browser. When you enter a website's address into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which includes the content of the website.

HTTP is just one of many protocols that make the internet work, but it is an important one because it allows us to access and interact with websites and other online resources. Arrr!

### **HTTP error codes**

HTTP error codes are a set of standardized codes that are used to indicate the status of an HTTP request. They are returned by the server in the HTTP response, and can be used to determine whether a request was successful or not.

Here are some of the most common HTTP error codes:

- 200 OK - The request was successful
- 301 Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been moved permanently
- 302 Found - The requested resource has been moved temporarily
- 400 Bad Request - The request was invalid
- 401 Unauthorized - The request requires authentication
- 403 Forbidden - The server refused to fulfill the request
- 404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found
- 500 Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server
- 503 Service Unavailable - The server is currently unavailable

For a bit of a laugh, here is an image you'll see as a 404 error page on some of my applications: (not to be taken seriously)

![404](../../images/404.png)

Here are some more obscure HTTP error codes:

- 418 I'm a teapot - The server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot
- 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons - The requested resource is unavailable due to legal reasons

### **HTTP methods**

HTTP methods are a set of standardized methods that are used to indicate the action that should be performed for a given resource. They are used in the HTTP request, and can be used to determine what action should be performed on the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP methods:

- **GET** - Retrieve a resource
- **POST** - Create a resource
- **PUT** - Update a resource
- **DELETE** - Delete a resource

HTTP methods can also be used to indicate the type of data that is being sent in the request. For example, the `Content-Type` header can be used to indicate that the request body contains JSON data.

Here are some of the most common `Content-Type` values:

- `application/json` - JSON data
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - Form data
- `multipart/form-data` - Form data with file uploads

### **HTTP headers**

HTTP headers are a set of standardized fields that are used to send additional information with an HTTP request or response. They are used to provide additional context about the request or response, and can be used to pass additional information between the client and the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP headers:

- `Accept` - The types of data that the client can accept
- `Accept-Encoding` - The types of data encoding that the client can accept
- `Accept-Language` - The languages that the client can accept
- `Authorization` - The credentials that the client can use to authenticate
- `Cache-Control` - The caching behavior that the client can accept
- `Content-Length` - The length of the request body
- `Content-Type` - The type of data that is contained in the request body
- `Cookie` - The cookies that the client can send to the server
- `Host` - The host name of the server
- `User-Agent` - The user agent that the client is using

HTTP headers can also be used to pass additional information between the client and the server. For example, the `X-Forwarded-For` header can be used to pass the IP address of the client to the server.

### **HTTPS**

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) can be thought of as a way to secure communication between two parties. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet, and it is designed to provide an additional layer of security on top of the regular HTTP protocol.

Imagine that two pirates are trying to send messages to each other over the internet, but they are worried that their messages might be intercepted by other pirates or other parties. To secure their communication, they could use HTTPS. When they use HTTPS, their messages are encrypted, which means that they are transformed into a code that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient. This makes it much harder for anyone else to intercept and read the messages, as they would need to have the key to decrypt the code.

In addition to encryption, HTTPS also provides authentication, which means that it can verify the identity of the sender and the recipient. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third party tries to intercept and manipulate the communication between two parties.

Overall, HTTPS is a useful tool for pirates (or anyone else) who want to keep their communication private and secure. It can help protect against interception and tampering, and it can also provide reassurance that the messages are actually coming from the intended sender.

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**

An API (Application Programming Interface) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of an API as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

APIs are often used to retrieve data from a server, but they can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **GraphQL (Graph Query Language)**

GraphQL (Graph Query Language) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of GraphQL as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

GraphQL is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

REST (Representational State Transfer) can be thought of as a set of standardized principles that are used to design web applications. It is a way to design web applications so that they can be easily accessed and used by clients.

In a pirate theme, you could think of REST as a set of principles that are used to design web applications. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

REST is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of SOAP as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server.

SOAP is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

## **SSH**

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secret code that allows pirates to remotely control their ships and protect their communications from prying eyes.

SSH is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer over an unsecured network, such as the internet. It is often used to remotely access and control servers, but it can also be used to securely transfer files and perform other tasks.

To use SSH, you need an SSH client, which is a program that connects to an SSH server. When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

### **SSH Agent**

SSH Agent is a program that can be used to store and manage private keys on a Linux system. It can be used to securely store private keys, which can be used to authenticate SSH connections.

SSH Agent is typically configured using a configuration file called sshd_config, which is located in the /etc/ssh directory. This file contains a list of configuration options that can be used to customize the behavior of the SSH agent.

```bash
# Start an SSH Agent for the current shell:
eval $(ssh-agent)
# Kill the currently running agent:
ssh-agent -k
```

> **Note** The `eval $(ssh-agent)` command can be added to your shell configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc`, to automatically start an SSH agent when you open a new shell.

You can use the `ssh-add` command to add private keys to the SSH agent. You can also use the `ssh-add` command to remove private keys from the SSH agent.

```bash
# Add the default ssh keys in `~/.ssh` to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add
# Add a specific key to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add path/to/private_key
# List fingerprints of currently loaded keys:
ssh-add -l
# Delete a key from the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -d path/to/private_key
# Delete all currently loaded keys from the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -D
# Add a key to the ssh-agent and the keychain:
ssh-add -K path/to/private_key
```

### **SSH Keys**

SSH keys are a type of secret code that can be used to authenticate a user when connecting to an SSH server. SSH keys are a more secure alternative to passwords, as they are much harder to guess or brute force.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. If you provide a private key, the SSH server will use the corresponding public key to authenticate you. If the public key matches the private key, you will be granted access to the server.

SSH keys are widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. They are a more secure alternative to passwords, and are an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

#### **How to generate SSH keys**

To generate SSH keys, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command. This command will generate a private key and a public key, which can be used to authenticate you when connecting to an SSH server.

```bash
# Generate a key interactively:
ssh-keygen
# Specify file in which to save the key:
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/filename
# Generate an ed25519 key with 100 key derivation function rounds:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100
# Generate an RSA 4096-bit key with email as a comment:
ssh-keygen -t dsa|ecdsa|ed25519|rsa -b 4096 -C "comment|email"
# Remove the keys of a host from the known_hosts file (useful when a known host has a new key):
ssh-keygen -R remote_host
# Retrieve the fingerprint of a key in MD5 Hex:
ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ~/.ssh/filename
# Change the password of a key:
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/filename
```

### **SSH Port Forwarding**

SSH port forwarding is a feature that allows you to forward traffic from a local port to a remote port on an SSH server. This can be useful for accessing services that are only available on a remote server, such as a web server or database.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH port forwarding is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

### **SSH Tunneling**

SSH tunneling is a feature that allows you to forward traffic from a local port to a remote port on an SSH server. This can be useful for accessing services that are only available on a remote server, such as a web server or database.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

### **Poor man's VPN (scurvy dog's sneak way)**

[sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle)

sshuttle (a poor man's VPN) is a tool that uses SSH to create a VPN between your local machine and a remote server. It can be used to access services that are only available on a remote server, such as a web server or database.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

## **SSL/TLS**

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) be a set of protocols that be usin' SSL certificates to secure websites and other online services. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

### **SSL Certificates**

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates be a type of digital certificate that be used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a client, such as a web browser. This be makin' it more difficult for third parties to intercept or tamper with the communication between the server and client.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

In the context of nginx, ye might be usin' an SSL certificate to secure the connection between nginx and the clients that be connectin' to it, such as web browsers. To do this, ye will need to obtain an SSL certificate and configure nginx to use it.

There be a few different types of SSL certificates, each with its own level of validation and security. Some be more expensive and time-consuming to obtain, but offer a higher level of trust and security.

I hope this be helpin' ye to understand how SSL certificates be workin' and how ye might be usin' them with nginx. Ahoy!

#### **Self-signed SSL Certificates**

Self-signed SSL certificates be a type of digital certificate that be used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a client, such as a web browser. This be makin' it more difficult for third parties to intercept or tamper with the communication between the server and client.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

### **Let's Encrypt**

Let's Encrypt be a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) that be usin' SSL certificates to secure websites and other online services. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

Certbot be a free, open-source tool that be usin' Let's Encrypt to obtain and install SSL certificates. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) be a non-profit organization that be workin' to protect and advance digital rights. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

### **Certificate Authorities**

A certificate authority (CA) be a trusted third party that be usin' SSL certificates to secure websites and other online services. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

### **CAA Records**

A CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) record be a type of DNS record that be usin' SSL certificates to secure websites and other online services. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

### **OCSP Stapling**

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) stapling be a method of improving the performance of SSL/TLS connections by caching the results of OCSP requests. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

### **OCSP Must-Staple**

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) must-staple be a method of improving the performance of SSL/TLS connections by caching the results of OCSP requests. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

## **TCP/IP**

TCP/IP be a suite of networking protocols that be used to connect devices on the internet. It be the foundation of the internet, and it be what allow devices to communicate with each other and exchange data over the network.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) be a protocol that be used to establish and maintain connections between devices on the network. It be responsible for dividing data into smaller packets and sending them over the network, and it be also responsible for ensuring that the packets be delivered to the destination reliably.

IP (Internet Protocol) be a protocol that be used to route packets of data between devices on the network. It be responsible for assigning unique addresses to devices on the network and routing packets to the correct destination based on these addresses.

Together, TCP and IP be the backbone of the internet, and they be what allow devices to communicate and exchange data with each other. So hoist the mainsail and set course for TCP/IP mastery! With a solid understanding of these protocols, ye'll be well on yer way to becoming a skilled network administrator. Arrrr!

## **UDP**

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a communication protocol that is used to transmit data over networks, such as the internet. It is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than protocols that require a connection to be established, but it also means that data transmitted using UDP is less reliable, as there is no guarantee that the data will be received by the intended recipient.

You might imagine UDP as a way for pirates to send messages to each other without having to go through the trouble of setting up a formal communication channel. They could simply send a message using UDP and hope that it gets to the intended recipient, much like a pirate sending a message in a bottle and hoping it reaches its destination.
