## **DNS (Domain Name System)**

In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that maps human-readable domain names (such as "example.com") to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS helps to make it easier for people to access websites and other online resources, as it allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of having to remember complex numerical addresses.

In a pirate theme, you could think of DNS as a way to navigate the vast and often-treacherous seas of the internet. Just as a map helps a pirate to find their way from one island to another, DNS helps to guide internet users to the websites and online resources they are looking for. Instead of having to remember the exact location of each island (website), a pirate can simply consult their map (DNS) to find the right route.

DNS also helps to ensure that internet users can reach their destination even if the underlying landscape (IP addresses) changes. Just as a pirate might need to adjust their course if the winds or currents shift, DNS can automatically route internet users to the correct location even if the underlying IP addresses change. This helps to make the internet more reliable and accessible, even in the midst of constantly-changing conditions.

### **Types of DNS Records**

There are several different types of DNS records that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. The most common types of DNS records are A records, which map a domain name to a single IP address, and CNAME records, which map a domain name to another domain name. Other types of DNS records include MX records, which map a domain name to an email server, and TXT records, which can be used to store arbitrary text data.

### **Examples of DNS Records**

**A record:**

`pirate.com.      IN A      127.0.0.1`

This A record maps the domain name "pirate.com" to the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

**CNAME record:**

`pirateship.pirate.com.      IN CNAME      pirate.com.`

This CNAME record maps the domain name "pirateship.pirate.com" to the domain name "pirate.com".

**MX record:**

`pirate.com.      IN MX      10 mail.pirate.com.`

This MX record specifies that the mail server for the domain "pirate.com" is located at "mail.pirate.com". The number "10" is the preference value, which determines the priority of the mail server.

**NS record:**

`pirate.com.      IN NS      ns1.pirate.com.
pirate.com.      IN NS      ns2.pirate.com.`

These NS records specify the name servers for the domain "pirate.com".

### **DNS servers**

Ahoy there! DNS servers be the computers that store the DNS records for a given domain. When a user tries to access a website, their computer will first query a DNS server to find the IP address for the requested domain. The DNS server will then return the IP address to the user's computer, which can then use the IP address to connect to the requested website.

**DNSSEC**

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) be a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that help to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and authentic. It does this by adding digital signatures to DNS records, which can be used to verify that the DNS records have not been tampered with. It also adds a mechanism for verifying that the DNS server that is responding to a query be the correct DNS server for the requested domain.

**DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over HTTPS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over TLS (DoT)**

DNS over TLS (DoT) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over TLS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over QUIC (DoQ)**

DNS over QUIC (DoQ) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over QUIC instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNSCrypt**

DNSCrypt be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private. It does this by encrypting DNS queries and responses using the NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library) encryption library.

**DNS Amplification Attacks**

DNS amplification attacks be a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic. They work by sending a large number of DNS queries to a DNS server, which will then respond to each query with a large amount of data. This can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic, which can cause the server to become overloaded and crash.

**Hosts file**

The hosts file be a file that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. It be typically located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux systems, but the exact location may vary depending on the operating system. The hosts file can be used to override the DNS records for a given domain, which can be useful for testing purposes.

## **Networking**

[PacketLife](https://packetlife.net/)

Ahoy there me hearties! Welcome to the wonderful world of computer networking, where the bytes flow like rum and the packets be flyin' like cannonballs. Ye be a fresh recruit to the tech industry, and it be time for ye to learn the ropes of this digital high seas.

First things first, let's talk about the lingo of the land. Ye be hearin' words like "MAC addresses" and "frames" thrown around like a shanty at a crew singalong. A MAC address be a unique identifier for a device on a network, kind of like a pirate's tattoo. And frames, why they be like the hull of a ship, holdin' all the important information together as it travels across the network.

Next, we have packets, the little buccaneers of data, carryin' information from one port to another. And just like how a pirate ship needs a crew to navigate, packets be usin' protocols like TCP and IP to make sure they reach their destination safe and sound.

And what be a network without a map? Ye be needin' IP addresses to navigate these digital waters and find yer way to other ships. And just like how ye need a compass to find true north, ye be usin' DNS to find the IP address of a website.

Routing protocols be like the maps and compass of the network world, they help guide packets to their destination. Let's take a look at some of the most commonly used ones:

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** This be a link state routing protocol, it's used mostly in large enterprise networks and service providers. It builds a map of the entire network and uses the shortest path to route the packets.

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** This be a Cisco proprietary protocol, it's similar to OSPF but it's more efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and faster convergence. It's mostly used in Cisco networks.

**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** This be one of the oldest routing protocols, it's simple to configure and it's mostly used in small networks. It uses hop count as the metric for determining the best path for routing.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** This be the king of routing protocols, it's used to route packets between different autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. It's more complex to configure than the other protocols and it's mostly used by service providers and large organizations. It uses a path vector algorithm to determine the best path.

**IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** This be another link-state routing protocol, it's mainly used in large service provider networks and it's similar to OSPF.

So, as you may expect BGP be specially important for internet routing and used for interconnect different networks, it's a robust and complex protocol that requires a good understanding of how internet routing works.

So there ye have it, a quick overview of the most common routing protocols. Remember, just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator, a network needs a good routing protocol to reach its destination.

So grab yerself a mug of grog and set sail on this journey through the tech industry. And remember, always keep a lookout for them scallywag hackers tryin' to steal yer treasure.

Yarr!

`arp`: This command be used to display and manipulate the system's ARP cache. Ye can use it to view the ARP cache, add or delete entries, and more.

  Ahoy matey! An ARP request be like a call to the crew of another ship, askin' for their location on the network. Ye see, on a ship, ye need to know where everyone be to coordinate yer actions. Same goes for a network, each device needs to know the location of other devices to communicate with them.

  An ARP request be a broadcast message sent by a device, askin' other devices on the network "Where be the device with this IP address? Give me its MAC address so I can talk to it." And just like how a crew member would respond with their location, the other devices on the network respond with their MAC address.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good lookout to spot other ships, a network needs ARP to spot other devices and communicate with them.

  Yarr!

`ip`: This command be used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

`ping`: This command be used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. Ye can use it to check if yer system be able to reach another device on the network.

`traceroute`: This command be used to trace the route between yer system and another device on the network. Ye can use it to see the path that packets be taking between yer system and the destination.

`netstat`: This command be used to display information about yer system's network connections and routing tables. Ye can use it to view information about active connections and network routes.

  Ahoy matey! ICMP be like a messenger bird for yer network, it be used for sendin' error messages and status information between devices. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs to send messages to other ships to coordinate actions, a network needs to send messages to other devices to coordinate communication.

  ICMP be used for a variety of things, such as letting a device know that it can't reach a destination, or that a destination is too busy to respond. It also be used for diagnostic purposes, such as the "ping" command, which be like shoutin' "Ahoy!" to a ship to see if they be there.

  And just like how a pirate ship needs a good messenger to send important messages, a network needs ICMP to send important information between devices.

  SNMP be like the ship's log of yer network, it be used for keepin' track of all the happenings on the network and givin' ye information about the devices connected to it. Ye see, just like how a pirate ship needs a log to keep track of its journey, a network needs SNMP to keep track of what's happening on it.

  SNMP be used for monitorin' and managin' devices on a network, it be used to gather information about the devices, such as their uptime, CPU usage, and memory usage, and it can also be used to change settings on the devices.

  SNMP be based on a client-server model, the devices on the network be the "servers" and the network management system be the "client". The client sends SNMP requests to the servers and the servers respond with the requested information.

  SNMP is one of the most common protocol for network management, it's easy to use and widely supported by many different vendors. And just like how a pirate ship needs a good navigator to find its way, a network needs SNMP to find its way around and keep track of everything.

  Yarr!

`route`: This command be used to view and modify the routing table on yer system. Ye can use it to add, delete, or modify routes on yer system.

#### **ip**

Ahoy matey! The `ip` command is used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

```

#### **Netcat**

Ahoy matey! Netcat, or `nc`, is a command-line utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. Just like how a pirate might use a telescope to spy on their enemies, `nc` can be used to spy on network connections and send data to and receive data from network services.

```bash
# To open a TCP connection from <src-port> to <dest-port> of <dest-host>, with a timeout of <seconds>
nc -p <src-port> -w <seconds> <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Open a TCP connection from <src-port> to <dest-port> on <dest-host>, with a deadline of <seconds>"
# To open a UDP connection to <dest-port> of <dest-host>:
nc -u <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Open a UDP connection to <dest-port> on <dest-host>"
# To open a TCP connection to port 42 of <host> using <source-host> as the IP for the local end of the connection:
nc -s <source-host> <dest-host> <port>   # "Open a TCP connection to port 42 on <dest-host> using <source-host> as the IP for the local end"
# To create and listen on a UNIX-domain stream socket:
nc -lU /var/tmp/dsocket   # "Create and listen on a UNIX-domain stream socket at /var/tmp/dsocket"
# To connect to <dest-port> of <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>,
# <proxy-port>. This example could also be used by ssh(1); see the ProxyCommand
# directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.
nc -x<proxy-host>:<proxy-port> -Xconnect <dest-host> <dest-port>   # "Connect to <dest-port> on <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>:<proxy-port>"
# The same example again, this time enabling proxy authentication with username "ruser" if the proxy requires it:
nc -x<proxy-host>:<proxy-port> -Xconnect -Pruser <host> <port>   # "Connect to <dest-port> on <dest-host> via an HTTP proxy at <proxy-host>:<proxy-port>, enabling proxy authentication with username 'ruser' if necessary"
