# **CI/CD**

CI/CD be a software development practice where code changes be automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows for faster and more frequent updates to a software application, as code changes be automatically deployed as soon as they pass testing. This can help to reduce the risk of deployments, as well as speed up the time it take for new features or bug fixes to reach users.

### **Continuous Integration**

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration is then automatically built and tested to ensure that the code changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous integration as a way to keep your ship (the software application) in good repair. Instead of waiting until the end of a long voyage to fix any problems with the ship, continuous integration allows you to make small repairs and improvements as you go. By regularly integrating and testing code changes, you can catch and fix problems early, before they become bigger issues that could sink the ship. This helps to ensure that your ship is always ready to set sail and that you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) as they arise.

### **Continuous Delivery**

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows for faster and more frequent updates to a software application, as code changes can be automatically deployed as soon as they pass testing. This can help to reduce the risk of deployments, as well as speed up the time it takes for new features or bug fixes to reach users.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous delivery as a way to quickly and efficiently get your ship (the software application) ready for battle. Instead of spending a lot of time preparing and repairing the ship before each voyage (deployment), continuous delivery allows you to make small, incremental changes to the ship as needed, so that it is always ready to set sail. This way, you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) and be better prepared for whatever the seas (your users) might throw your way.

## **CI/CD Tools**
