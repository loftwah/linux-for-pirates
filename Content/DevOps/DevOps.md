## **What is DevOps?**

Ahoy matey! Let's talk about DevOps, ye landlubbers!

DevOps be a bunch o' tools, practices, and a philosophy that be gettin' the software development and IT teams walkin' the plank together. It be all about workin' as a crew, communicatin' like parrots, and automatin' all the processes!

Yarr, this be startin' 'round 2007, when the software development and IT teams started grievin' 'bout the old way of doin' things, with the developers writin' code and the IT operations hoisting the sails and keepin' the ship afloat. But DevOps changed all that! It brought the two teams together, like rum and coconuts!

Under DevOps, there be no more "silos". Sometimes, the two teams be mergin' into one big happy crew, with engineers workin' on all parts of the journey from developin' to deploying and operatin'.

DevOps teams use tools to make the journey smoother and quicker, like a good set of sails on a calm day. They use a bunch o' tools called the "DevOps toolchain" to help 'em tackle the important stuff, like continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and workin' together like a well-oiled crew!

Even the security teams be gettin' in on the action, with a thing called "DevSecOps". It's like havin' a lookout on the masthead, keepin' a keen eye out for danger at all times!

The DevOps journey be like a never-endin' loop, always improvin' and changin', like the wind direction on a voyage. It's made up of eight phases, representin' the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development and operations. And throughout it all, the teams be workin' and communicatin' together, like a good crew on a ship!

So hoist the sails and set course for DevOps, me hearties! Yarrr!

### **How DevOps Works?**

Under the DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer siled. Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

It is an ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

## **Docker**

Arr matey, ye be askin' about Docker, the popular containerization software that be makin' it easier to ship, run, and manage applications.

Docker be usin' containers to package up an application with all of the parts it be needin' to run, such as libraries and dependencies, and ship it as one package. This be makin' it easier to run the application on any other machine, regardless of the specific environment or configuration.

To work with Docker, ye might be usin' the Docker Engine to build, run, and manage containers. Ye can build your own containers or use ones that other scallywags have built and shared. Ye can also use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications, makin' it easier to scale and manage them.

In terms of practical use, ye might be usin' Docker to set up a development environment for your application, or to package and deploy your application to production. Ye can also use Docker to run databases or other services that your application relies on.

So there ye have it, a brief overview of Docker and how ye might be workin' with it. I hope this be helpin' ye to understand this powerful tool for managing and running applications. Shiver me timbers!

### **Install Docker**

To install Docker, ye can follow the instructions on the Docker website. Ye can also use the Docker Toolbox to install Docker on Windows and Mac.

#### **Docker Engine**

Docker Engine be a client-server application that be used to build, run, and manage Docker containers. The Docker Engine be made up of two parts: the Docker daemon and the Docker client.

The Docker daemon be a background service that be runnin' on yer computer. It be responsible for building, runnin', and distributing yer Docker containers. The Docker client be the command line tool that ye use to interact with the Docker daemon.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```

Once Docker be installed, ye can verify that it be workin' by runnin' the docker version command in a terminal window.

### **Docker Compose**

[Awesome Compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)

Docker Compose be a tool for defining and runnin' multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, ye can use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, ye can create and start all the services from yer configuration.

#### **Install Docker Compose**

To install Docker Compose, ye can follow the instructions on the Docker Compose website. Ye can also use the Docker Toolbox to install Docker Compose on Windows and Mac.

```bash
COMPOSE_VERSION=`git ls-remote https://github.com/docker/compose | grep refs/tags | grep -oE "[0-9]+\.[0-9][0-9]+\.[0-9]+$" | sort --version-sort | tail -n 1`
sudo sh -c "curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo sh -c "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/${COMPOSE_VERSION}/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose > /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose"
```

### **Docker Swarm**

[Docker Swarm Rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks/)

Docker Swarm be a native clustering tool for Docker. It be used to deploy and manage a cluster of Docker Engines.

## **Kubernetes**

Kubernetes (also known as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps to provide a consistent and reliable environment for running applications, regardless of where they are deployed.

In a pirate theme, you could think of Kubernetes as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships (the containerized applications). Instead of having to manually deploy and manage each ship individually, Kubernetes allows you to automate the process and scale your fleet as needed. This can help you to be more efficient and responsive, as you can deploy new ships or make changes to existing ones more quickly and easily.

Kubernetes also helps to ensure that your ships are running smoothly and reliably, by providing features like automatic self-healing, rolling updates, and resource management. This can help to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Infrastructure as Code**

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way to define and manage your infrastructure and its dependencies using code, rather than manually configuring resources through a graphical user interface. This allows you to version control your infrastructure, automate the provisioning and management of resources, and apply testing and deployment practices similar to those used in software development.

In a pirate theme, you could think of infrastructure as code as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships and their various systems and equipment. Instead of manually configuring and repairing each ship's sails, masts, and engines, you could use code to define how these components should be set up and configured. This would allow you to automate the process of building and repairing your ships, as well as make it easier to scale your fleet as needed.

By using infrastructure as code, you can also more easily track and manage changes to your ships' systems and equipment over time, as well as roll back any changes that might cause problems. This can help you to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

### **YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)**

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure maps and their plans for future raids.

In software engineering and devops, YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files and in applications that need to process data from multiple sources. It is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and is often used as an alternative to XML or JSON.

To use YAML, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on indentation and key-value pairs. A key-value pair consists of a unique key, followed by a colon, followed by the value. Indentation is used to indicate the hierarchy of the data, with each level of indentation representing a new level in the hierarchy.

YAML is a popular choice for configuration files because it is easy to read and write, and it is flexible enough to support a wide variety of data structures. It is also often used in devops tools, such as Ansible and Docker, to define infrastructure as code.

To use YAML effectively as a pirate, you should familiarize yourself with its syntax and conventions, and understand how it is used in the tools and technologies you are working with. Arrr!
